            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>he ſaid theſe wordes:</hi> Let vs make man vnto our image &amp; ſimilitude, who shal rule ouer the fishes of the ſea, the foules of the ayre, and beaſtes of the earth. <hi>The holy Doctors ſay: that if the firſt man had perſeuered in the ſtate of innocency, and had conſerued original iuſtice, in the which God created him, all the creatures had acknowledged him for their Lord, and had bene obedient vnto him; but for that he was diſobedient vnto God, all creatures were diſobedient, and became foes vnto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame thing happened vnto man which, befalleth vnto a hunter, who going out to hunt, all the dogges leap about him, and fawne and lick him, but if he should put on a viſard, it is likly inough they would not acknowledg him, but would look angerly, grin, and ſwarle at him. Euen ſo befell it vnto our firſt father</hi> Adam; <hi>after that he put the viſard of diſobedience on his face; Before that all creatures eſteemed and ſerued him, and acknowledged
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:181136:4"/>him for the ſuperiour, but afterward, they all rebelled, making warre againſt him, as againſt their common enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neuertheles, God being merciful (to the end, that ſome ſigne of that happy eſtate might be ſeene) permitted, that there should be ſome ſo holie and faithfull, that vnto them many creatures should ſerue, and be obedient. As we haue an example of</hi> S. Giles. <hi>VVho was cherished by a hinde a while, and mainteined by her milk, the time he remained in a caue, of a ſoltary and craggy mountaine. The life of this holy Abbot and Confeſſor, was written by</hi> Gilbertus. <hi>B. of</hi> Carnotum, <hi>and other Authors in this manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Giles</hi> was borne in <hi>Athens</hi> of the Royall bloude. His father was called <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and his mother <hi>Pelagia;</hi> From his childhood he was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the ſtudies of humanity, and diuinity alſo, and in the ſame age he gaue himſelf vnto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, exerciſing himſelf in good workes. He was of ſingular charity, and gaue much almoſe. He went one day vnto the church, &amp; ſawe a poore ſick man in the ſtreet, who asked an almes of him, and he taking the garment he wore, gaue it to the poore man, who took it, and put it on, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he became perfectly whole. Not long after this, his father died, and he diſtributed al his patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (which was very great) amongſt the needy.</p>
               <p>God shewed many miracles by the meanes of this holy Saint: one was, when he healed a man that was bitten by a venemous ſerpent, ſo that he was at the point of death. Another was, he being one ſonday at a Church, there came in a man po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the diuell, and made ſuch a noiſe that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:181136:4"/>the deuine office could not be heard. The holy man praied for him, and not only obteined that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in him did hold peace, but alſo did depart out of him &amp; left him free. Through all <hi>Greece</hi> the fame of <hi>S. Giles</hi> was ſpred, wherupon he fearing to be honoured, and reputed for a holy man, tooke ſea, intending to go into ſome country, where he should not be knowen. The bark was not far from the shore, but a huge tempeſt aroſe, ſo that euery one made accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to perish in the ſea. <hi>S. Giles</hi> praied, and the ſtorme ceaſed, by which all the mariners and paſſengers wel perceiued, that the ſtorme cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his praiers, and they yelded vnto him many thankes for the ſame.</p>
               <p>After a fewe daies the barck arriued at a hauen in <hi>France,</hi> where <hi>S. Giles</hi> took land, and went to the city of <hi>Arlez,</hi> where a holy man called <hi>Ceſarius</hi> was Bishop. The holy Saint ſtaied in his company two yeares, to the great content of them both, for that all their conference and conuerſation was of heauenly matters. In that place <hi>S. Giles</hi> by his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers healed a man, which had bene ſick of a feuer three yeares; And becauſe that deed, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> cauſed him to be had in great reuerence, and that euery one called him the holy man, he reſolued to depart, and to fly from the reputation and honor of the world (though the conuerſation and company of <hi>Ceſarius</hi> pleaſed him much.) So he paſſed ouer the riuer of <hi>Rhoſne</hi> which is wel knowen in that realme, &amp; he founde on the bank therof, a holly hermit called <hi>Veredemius,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a ſolitary life; with whom he ſtaied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued certaine daies: And wheras the countrey

               <p>It happened, that on a time a ſick man was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vnto the cell of <hi>Veredemius</hi> to be healed by him, but it falling out that he was not at home at that time, <hi>S. Giles</hi> praied for him, and healed him. There was neuer man that auoided to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deſpiſed, as <hi>S. Giles</hi> laboured to shunne, and to repell the eſtimation &amp; honor of the world; and therfore he departed from that place, &amp; went vnto an other which was more ſolitary, and fuller of woode, toward the mouth of the Riuer. In that place he found a cane among certein thornes, and other wild plantes, nere vnto which ſprang a cleare and pure fountaine. In it he alſo ſawe a hind, which made ſignes, to be content that he should lodge with her: ſo the holy man reſolued, to make his abode in that place. His food was the rootes of herbes, and running water, and ſometimes the hind permitted him to milk her, and in that ſort, he ſpent part of his life, paſſing the time in praier and meditation.</p>
               <p>It befell afterward, that the king who then reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>France,</hi> (being a Chriſtian) went one day on hunting, and his houndes found the hind of S. <hi>Giles,</hi> and purſued her hard to kill her. Shee with a ſwift courſe ranne back vnto the caue, where the holy man remained, and lay at his feet, as it were, to demaund ſuccor and help at his handes in that danger. when the hind came into the caue, S. <hi>Giles</hi> was at his praiers on his knees; &amp; though he ſawe his hoſteſſe that gaue him lodging, in manifeſt daunger, he did not therfore ariſe from his exerciſe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:181136:5"/>but he beſought God to defend and deliuer her. The praier of the holy Confeſſor was hearde, for by the power of God, the dogges could not enter into the caue, but ſtood a good way of and barked.</p>
               <p>At this noiſe the king &amp; the other hunters came in, but they being not able to enter the caue, one that caried a crosbowe, put a quarell therin, which he shot of toward the caue; determinating to make triall what was within: and the quarell, or arrowe, (be what it was), lighted vpon the holy Saint, and wounded him, who patiently tollerated the wound which was made. The hunters paſſed through the thornes and braunches, determining to ſee what was in the caue, and at the laſt they came to the place where S. <hi>Giles</hi> was. It ſeemed vnto euery one of them a ſtrange ſpectacle, to ſee him at the mouth of the caue, on his knees, with a graue and venerable aſpect, and nothing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; looking with his face and eyes, and likewiſe his handes lifted toward heauen; The wound had made him all bloudie, and the hind lay cloſe by his ſide.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges put the King and all his people in great dread; wherfore he went vnto him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting him a holy man, made obeyſaunce and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued pardon of him, becauſe his bowe-bearer had wounded him, &amp; gaue order, that prouiſion should be made for his cure, though the holy Saint made therunto deniall, wishing that the wound and the ſore might continew all his life, that it might be an occaſion wherby he might haue more merite. The king offered vnto him great ſommes of mony, to the end he should pray vnto God for him, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:181136:6"/>the holy Saint would not accept any guiftes, but perſwaded him, to lay out that which he deſired to beſtow on him, in building of a monaſtery, in which religious men might dwell, that should pray vnto God for him and for his kingdome. The king was well pleaſed therewith, &amp; cauſed a monaſtery to be builded: of the which, the holy man was compelled by the importunity of the king, to take on him the gouernment with the title of Abbot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Giles</hi> liued in this monaſtery certain yeares, and all that time he ſpent in praiers and faſtinges; endeuouring that euery one should fly from ſinne, and attend to the ſeruice of God. This may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appere by the ſame king, who was obſtinate in a certaine ſinne he had committed, and therof had ſmall remorſe and greefe, and leſſe wil to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, yet ſo much the praier of <hi>S. Giles</hi> preuailed, that the king confeſſed it with great ſorrowe of mind, and repentance for his treſpaſſe, and all other offences committed in his life. It is ſaid: that the holy Saint went vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and at his returne brought many indulgences and pardons, graunted vnto him by the Popes, for his monaſteries, aſwell for them that dwelt therin, and wore his habite, as alſo for them that viſited it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Giles</hi> hauing gouerned his monaſtery (no leſſe religiouſly then holylie,) certain yeares, the time of his death approched, which was agreable vnto his good and vertuous life, leauing behind him a holy enuy vnto all them, that were preſent at that time, for it was apparant and euident, that he went to poſſeſſe the kingdome of heauen, where was for him prepared a moſt honourable place. His
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:181136:6"/>glorious death was on the firſt day of <hi>September,</hi> and theron the Church celebrateth his feaſt.</p>
               <p>In the hiſtory of the life of this holy Saint it is written, that <hi>S.

That which we can extract out of this Author, and out of other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologes concerning the life of theſe holy Saints, is: That they were martirized in <hi>Beneuento,</hi> in the time of <hi>Valerian</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> in the yeare of our Lord. 258.</p>
               <p>The names of the holy martires were thes: <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus, Faelix, Acontius, Honoratus, Fortunatus, Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus, Soptimius, Ianuarius, Faelix, Secundus, Vitalis,

They all preached the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of IESVS CHRIST and many were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto the faith of CHRIST by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</p>
               <p>They were all layed in moſt dark priſons; Then were they taken foorth, and brought into the high ſtreet, where they thruſt their handes hard into certain pieces of wood, and afterward made fier vnderneth them. Then in the preſence of the ſame <hi>Valerian</hi> they bound them vnto certain cordes, and ropes, which ranne in polleis, and ſo hoiſed them alofe into the aire, then they let them falle on a ſoodaine, and gaue them the moſt cruell ſtrappado.</p>
               <p>This ſufficed not, but they alſo ſcourged them, and then tore and rent their flesh with hookes of Iron, to the execeſſiue paine &amp; torment of the holy martires; the officers herin diſplaying their cruell mindes. Then they put them to the fier again, and ſet the kindled torches to their bare ſides: but the holy Saints endured and abode all very conſtantly: which the tyrant ſeing, and awearied in putting them vnto ſo many torments, did laſtly cauſe all of them to be beheaded; and by this martirdome their mortall liues ended, and their ſoules went to the ioyes of heauen. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>

               </p>
               <p>Some holy doctors, as <hi>S. Cyrill, S. Iohn Damaſcen, S. Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> declare the maner therof. The ſubſtance of that which they ſay is this: that the bleſſed virgin, hauing conceiued IESVS CHRIST our Lord, shee was his mother, for that her moſt chaſt, pure, and more then illuſtrious
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:181136:9"/>bloud, ſerued for matter. of which the holy Ghoſt by his deuine vertue, formed the body of IESVS CHRIST, for which cauſe, shee became a true and veritable mother, as any other mothers be. Hauyng layd this foundation of truth, I ſay; that to be the mother of God, argueth the great noblenes and worthynes of this holy damoſell.</p>
               <p>This is proued by a principle, the phyloſophers hold, to wyt: that there is not only a proportion betweene the cauſe and the effect, but alſo, if the cauſe be not empeached or hindered, it produceth a like effect to it ſelfe, euen to the Indiuiduum, and the accidents: as a lyon, that hath ſpots, produceth not only another lyon, but alſo with the ſame ſpots. This being graunted: I ſay; that if the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall guifts of the wyt, complexion, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of members, &amp; naturall condition of CHRIST were tranſcendent, and excellent in the hieſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as it is apparant by the ſacred ſcripture, &amp; alſo ſaid by the holy doctors: we are by great reaſon to find all the ſame in the B. virgin, as in his true and veritable mother, to witt, that shee was of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wyt, an amyable complection, of an admy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beauty, &amp; abſolute proportion of limmes, and moſt goodly naturall condition. So that ſaying that IESVS CHRIST was <hi>the fairest of all men,</hi>

                  </note> the ſame may be affirmed of the B virgin. wherfore, we may well ſay thus: O lady vnto whom shall we liken thee? what goodlines shalbe like vnto thyne, who is ſo beutifull as thou art? The ſonne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto thee is foul and vgly, the moone is dark and obſcure, and the ſtarres are as clouds? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are far inferior, and the Seraphins come not

Behold the ſonne, in him you shall ſee a picture of the mother: note you that there is litle difference between the mother and the ſonne. Such a ſonne, and of ſuch and ſo great perfections, was fit for ſuch a mother, and ſuch a mother, endued with ſo many graces, was fit for ſuch a ſonne. yee ought alſo to conſider a heuenly workmanship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the B.

The mother gaue vnto him that which she had, to wit the humanity, and CHRIST being God, and fountein of grace, gaue it vnto his mother.</p>
               <p>Of this groweth two admirable things: The one is, that as the glorious virgin, for his nature is his mother, ſo is shee his daughter in reſpect of grace, ſo that the mother is daughter, and the ſonne is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that which other mothers ſay in ſport to their ſonnes, calling them: my king, my prince, my father, and my treaſor, the glorious virgin might ſay it in truth and verity. This alſo ariſeth betwene the mother and the ſonne, That as the ſonne for his humaine nature is made like vnto his mother, ſo the mother in reſpect of grace is like vnto the ſonne. Shee was humble (in proportion, not in equality) as he, charitable as he, obedyent as he, and in her proportion full of grace, as he, ſo the Angell called her, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:181136:10"/>goeth further: The virgin in his conception, beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towed the bloud of her vaines, of which to forme his body, and in the nyne moneths, that she caryed him in her wombe, ouer &amp; beſide the giuing vnto him, her moſt chaſt bowells, for his rich pallace, and the couerings and pannycles of her hart to be the tapiſſery of his chamber, shee alſo gaue him, the very ſame meate, shee took her ſelf: ſo that like a bliſſed doue, with her bill, shee put the nutriment in the mouth of her ſonne: After he was borne, the armes of his mother, was his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, &amp; holding him vnto her breſt, she warmed him better, then <hi>Abyſac</hi> warmed <hi>Dauid.</hi> IESVS being growen vp; his mother gaue him, her handes her care and diligence, to the end all things shee had might ſerue him. After he was dead, &amp; taken from the croſſe, shee took him alſo in her armes, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him with tender affection. All this gaue the mother vnto the ſonne.</p>
               <p>The ſonne gaue vnto the mother, grace in her conception, in preſeuring her from ſinne; he gaue vnto her the vſe of reaſon before the ordinary time, and at three yeres old, he conducted her as his owne vnto the Temple. Then he aduaunced her higher, vntill he made her his mother &amp; moſt fit for ſuch a ſonne, in ſuch maner, that shee is no reproch vnto CHRIST before his eternall father, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and all men. Yea he glorieth and ioyeth to haue ſuch a mother as <hi>Mary</hi> is. IESVS CHRIST and his mother were in this as other things, moſt faithfull louers; for the preſents and gifts the one had from the other liked them ſo well, that they neuer left them. IESVS had his humanity of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:181136:10"/>mother, and he ſo firmely embraced it, that as the deuines ſay, that which he once vnited to himſelf, he neuer laſt. He loſt his life in his paſſion, and in the three dayes he lay in the ſepulcher, the humane nature was not there: for his parts, to wit the body and the ſoule were ſeperated aſunder; but the parts were neuer ſeperated from the diuine <hi>Suppoſitum.</hi> It is alſo very cleare, that the iewels with which this infant was borne, and were beſtowed on her in her conception, were neuer loſt. for shee neuer commytted any mortall ſinne.</p>
               <p>Let vs then conclude this firſt tretiſe to wit of the nobility which accrewed and aroſe vnto the virgin, in being the mother of God, with the words of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to wyt: That to be the mother of God, is ſo great a dignity that by it shee ſurpaſſeth not only all mankind, but alſo all the Angels: Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as it is more to be the mother, rather then the ſeruant, ſo much is the dignity greater to be the mother of the prince, then to be his ſeruant. This reaſon alſo conuinceth it, for that ſo much the more is a thing aduanced in perfection, the more or nerer it is vnited to God, who is the hieſt perfection. This is the daughter, that is borne this day, the infant, whoſe feaſt the Catholike Church celebrateth: a litle infant, but a great Lady. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant whoſe graces cannot be expreſſed, but by him, that created her. THis is a day of great deſart, a day whoſe memorie reioyceth both heauen and earth. This is the day, in which shee is borne, of whom would be borne IESVS, that is called CHRIST. By the things before reherſed, you may know, how reaſonable it is to celebrate the

                  <hi>Natiuitie</hi> of this Virgin, for that her deſarts and graces be ſo great, as is aboue mentioned.</p>

               <p>The occaſion to celebrate this feaſt was; in one yeare and 8. moneths ſpace, no Pope was choſen, after the death of Pope <hi>Celeſtine.</hi> 4. which was the cauſe of infinite ſcandals through all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but eſpeciallie in <hi>Italy,</hi> for that the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> who rebelled againſt the Church, euerie day vſurped, and got ſome of the lands belonging vnto the Church. The Cardinals who were in the Conclaue deſired to make the election, but they could not agree. At laſt, they treated among them ſelfs (it being propounded by ſome deuout perſon vnto our Lady,) to make a vowe, that if any of them were made Pope in a short ſpace, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of thoſe great damages and loſſes of the Church, he should ordeine the celebration of the Natiuitie of our Ladie, and should make it a feaſt with octaues, through al Chriſtendome. The vowe being made, forthwith enſued the election of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Sinibaldus,</hi> who was called <hi>Innocent</hi> 4. who
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:181136:11"/>ordeined the Natiuity of our Lady to be kept on the. 8. day of <hi>September,</hi> through all Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>This election reioyced the wholle world that had longed for a pope, and for that the cauſe of this was aſcribed vnto the newe feaſt of the moſt B. vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, he ordeined that in the office, they should ſing this <hi>Antheme</hi> which beginneth: <hi>Natiuitas tua, dei genitrix virgo gaudium annunciauit vniuerſo mundo</hi> &amp;c: That is to ſay: Thy birth ô virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, brought ioye to the wholl world.</p>
               <p>Some Authors ſeeme to ſay:<note place="margin">Vine. in ſpec l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>119.</hi>
                  </note> that a relligious man liuing in contemplation, hard euery yere on the. 8. day of <hi>September</hi> the Angels to make melody and triumph; and demaunding of one of them, what was the cauſe of ſuch ioy in heauen, he was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that on that day, was celebrated the Natiuity of the mother of God, and that then vpon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of that relligious man, this feaſt began to be celebrated. It may be true, that this relligious man, had that before remembred viſion, but the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to promulgate the ſolemnity of this feaſt, is that, which I reherſed firſt.</p>
               <p>And to the end, ſome thing may be ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the hiſtory, collecting it out of that, which S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn Damaſcen, Gregory of Niſſen, and Simeon Metaphraſtes</hi> write therof, I ſay; that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> was called <hi>Ioachim,</hi> and her mother <hi>Anna:</hi> Thy were both of the tribe <hi>of Iuda,</hi> and of the houſe and family of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and this is to be holden as an Article of faith, for there be many prophecies in the holy writ, which ſay, that the MESSIAS should be borne of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and of the houſe and family of <hi>Dauid,</hi> And he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:181136:12"/>being to be borne of glorious virgin, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; that the father and mother of her, were to be of that tribe,<note place="margin">Hier. de ort. B. Vir. Luc. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> and of that family. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> nameth ſome patriarches, which muſt of neceſſity, be the ſame, which S. <hi>Luke</hi> nameth in his Goſpell. He ſaith then, that <hi>Iannes</hi> begot <hi>Melchi,</hi> and <hi>Melchi</hi> begot <hi>Leui,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Iohn lucid. l. <hi>2.</hi> de temp. hebr.</note> and Leui begot <hi>Mathan,</hi> and <hi>Mathan</hi> begot <hi>Heli,</hi> who is alſo called <hi>Ioachim,</hi> who (as he ſaith) was naturall father vnto the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> and legall father vnto <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioachim</hi> took <hi>Anna</hi> vnto wife, and both of them dwelt in <hi>Nazareth</hi> a citty of <hi>Galilee.</hi> They were very rich, and beſtowed part of their goods vpon the poore, and other pious vſes. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith alſo; that they continued together. 20. years, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had children, for which <hi>Iſſachar</hi> the prieſt, not only would not receue the offering of <hi>Ioachim</hi> in the temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> vpon a feaſt, which was kept there, and was called <hi>Encenia,</hi> but bad him to depart out of the temple, for that aſſuredly he had ſome ſecret ſinne for the which God punished him, and did not graunt him the fruit of benediction. So that <hi>Ioachim</hi> all afflicted and ashamed, departed from the temple. <hi>Gregory Nizen</hi> and <hi>Simeon Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastes</hi> ſay: that S. <hi>Anna</hi> vpon the like ſolemnity came from <hi>Nazareth</hi> vnto <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>

                  </note> and like the other <hi>Anna</hi> the mother of <hi>Samuel</hi> lamented, wept, and ſighed, in the Temple, deſiring God to graunt her children, and euen as <hi>Anna</hi> the mother of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> did, shee vowed to offer in the temple, vnto the ſeruice of God the ſonne or daughter, that God would be pleaſed to giue her.</p>
               <p>They ſay alſo, that afer shee had made the vowe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:181136:12"/>shee lay with her husband <hi>Ioachim,</hi> and conceiued, and was deliuered of the Queene of Angells, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> our aduocate. And though vſually, when daughters are borne, the father and mother do not reioyce ſo much, as if it were a ſonne; for that the daughters are trobleſome to bring vp, and to mainteine, &amp; more chargeable to ſet forth in marriage, yet when the B. virgin was borne, the father and mother felt, and taſted infinite ioy, as of a thing, they had long deſired. They alſo reioyced, for that they had ſome kinde of knowledg, that this their daughter should not be any charge to them for a dowry in mariage, but alſo by her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes God would showe many fauors, and bleſſings vpon all the world.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Bernard</hi> made this ſpeech vnto the B. virgin in theſe wordes: Happy art thou O Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> more then any other creature, ſince of thee, in thee and by thee, God hath recreated the wholle world, which he hath created. In that we haue ſaid before, we haue in part ſeen the great worth of the Queen newly borne, the order of her birth, &amp; her coming into the world: Now it remaineth (as the vſage is) to gratulate &amp; reioice with her father and mother, ſaying vnto them:</p>
               <p>O Holy and happy Patriark <hi>Ioachim</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> happy may the birth of your daughter be, wee pray God, yee may ſee her brought vp, and well married: without doubt it shalbe ſo: for God will giue vnto her for ſpouſe <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> one of the holieſt men, that shall be in the world. He shalbe her guard, and help; he shall not take of her the pledge dewe vnto ſpouſes, but rather by thes eſpouſalls,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:181136:13"/>shee shall remaine moſt pure and chaſt, as she was before, and euer shall be. Shee shall haue another ſpouſe in heauen, which shalbe God himſelf, to wit The <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the third perſon of the holy <hi>Trinity.</hi> He shall be her ſpouſe, and by him shee shall conceiue, without loſſe or dammage vnto her virginity, and hauing conceiued, shall bring forth into the world, our <hi>Sauior</hi> and <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After we haue thus reioiced with <hi>Ioachim</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> for that thy haue ſuch a daughter borne vnto them, we may alſo reioice with their other kinsfolke, for that they haue gotten nowe ſuch a kinſwoman. Let vs reioice alſo with the ſinners, for that nowe this day is borne their aduocate. Let vs reioice with the Angels, ſince that on this day is borne their Queene: let vs reioice with God, ſince on this day is borne his mother, daughter, and ſpouſe. And at the laſt, let vs reioice with the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin her ſelfe, ſince God hath elected her to ſuch gretnes and dignity: And the occaſion of this being, for that we be ſinners; for if ſinne had not bin God had not bin made man, and if he had not bin made man, shee had not bin his mother, Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without doute, ſhee being aduaunced to this gretnes by our occaſion, will remember vs, and obteine for vs, of the ſame God who is her ſonne, pardon and mercy for our ſinnes &amp; tranſgreſſions, and alſo his heauenly grace, that we may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his glory.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE Emperour <hi>Maximian</hi> commaunded; that the Chriſtians that were in the citie of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media</hi> a city of <hi>Bithinia</hi> should be diligently ſought out. Many were apprehended, and after that the Emperour had admonished, and willed them to adore the Idoll, and ſawe them conſtant and firme in the profeſſion of the faith of IESVS CHRIST, he bad them all to be chained vnto wodden poſtes, and to be beaten with the rawe ſinewes of beaſtes: and when he heard them in theyre tormentes to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:181136:14"/>praiſe the name of IESVS CHRIST, he cauſed their tounges to be cut out, and theire mouthes to be beaten with greate ſtones. The number of theſe martirs was 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adrian</hi> was preſent there, as an officer, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and ſee, that the commaundement of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour should be executed. He was an Idolater, and a man of good account with <hi>Maximian:</hi> And when he ſawe howe patiently the holy martirs tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated thoſe terrible tormentes, wondering therat he ſaid vnto them: I coniure you by the God which you adore, and for whom you ſuffer theſe torments, to tell me truly, what guerdon or reward you expect, for I ſuppoſe it to be very greate. The holy martirs, though they had no tonges, by the permiſſion of God anſwered him thus: The reward we expect is ſuch &amp; ſo greate, that eyes neuer ſawe it, nor eares haue hard it, nor the hart of man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not conceiue it, for it is an vnſpeakable good, which God hath prepared for his frends: <hi>Adrian</hi> hearing this, deſired not to heare any more, but being inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God, and shewing himſelfe deſirous to be partaker of ſo greate good, entred into the midſt of the martirs, and ſaid to the Regiſter, (before whom the matter was handled): write alſo my name with theſe ſoulders of CHRIST: for I will be a Chriſtian alſo, as they be.</p>
               <p>The Emperour was certified hereof: and when the name of <hi>Adrian</hi> was read vnto him, among the other Chriſtians which were priſoners: he cauſed him to be called, &amp; ſaid vnto him. O <hi>Adrian,</hi> what, art thou become foolish, that thou ſeekeſt to loſe thy life wretchedly? <hi>Adrian</hi> aunſwered: I haue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:181136:14"/>been, but nowe I am not a foole, for that I am a Chriſtian, and no more an Idolater, as I haue bene before time. The'mperour being deſirous to make him alter his purpoſe, diſcourſed, and conferred long with him, but ſeeing his words did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, in rage and fury he cauſed him to be chained and fettered and put in priſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adrian</hi> was about 28. yeares old, &amp; had to wife a woman called <hi>Natalia,</hi> who was a Chriſtian. When shee heard what had befallen vnto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, shee went with greate ioy vnto the priſon, and fell at his feet, and kiſſing his fetters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was gyued, ſaid vnto him: Bleſſed art thou, ô <hi>Adrian</hi> my husband, and my Lord, nowe thou haſt found the riches which thy father left not vnto thee: Paſſe ſecurely vnto IESVS CHRIST, in whom thou haſt repoſed thy treaſure, which thou shalt find herafter in the time of neceſſity, when no man shall be able to deliuer from punishment the wretch which shalbe condemned. The father shall not be able to deliuer the ſonne, nor the mother the daughter, nor the tranſitorie riches of the world, nor the ambition to haue many ſeruants, and a great patrimony, the freind shall not be of ability to help the freind, only the deedes which a man hath done, shall do a man good and pleaſure. Thou (my Lord) haſt IESVS CHRIST in thy company, in whom thou haſt depoſed and laid vp thy treaſures: walk in the way thou haſt begon, be not wery therof, to the end thou maieſt enioy the promiſes. Take heede, let not the remembrance of earthly and momentary things moue thee, to turne backward from thy way begon, nether let
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:181136:15"/>thy kinsfolks, nor the wailings of thy father and mother, nor the flattery of thy freinds, nor the menaces of thy enemies moue thee. Let not the torments of the tirant put thee in feare, but fixe thy eyes vpon the conſtancie &amp; patience of theſe holie martirs, which be with thee. Imitate them in life, and thou shalt be rewarded with them in death.</p>
               <p>The bleſſed woman hauing ſaid theſe words, went vnto the holy martirs, one by one, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their gyues and fetters, ſaieng: I beſeech you, ô ſeruants of IESVS CHRIST, to animate and encourage my husband, gaine you his ſoule, Be vnto him a father, that by your meanes, he may be regenerated vnto euerlaſting life. <hi>Adrian</hi> ſaid vnto his wife: Goe home from hence, my deare and chaſt ſiſter, for when the time shall come, that we shalbe examined and iudged, I will bring thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice therof, that thou maieſt be preſent, and ſee the end of this work.</p>
               <p>Certein daies after, <hi>S. Adrian</hi> vnderſtood that they reſolued to heare and determine the cauſes of him, and of the other priſoners which were with him: wherupon he gaue a large ſome of mony vnto the keepers of the priſon, (ſome of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance interceding and being his ſuerties) that he might go home vnto his houſe, promiſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torne back with ſpeed. <hi>Adrian</hi> was ſo well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all men, that they ſeemed not to deſire his returne vnto the priſon; they let him depart, and to eſcape if he would, though they knew and ſawe themſelfes in apparant daunger of life. And it is to be thought his ſuerties were in the ſame daunger.</p>
               <p>Forthwith ſome ranne before him to giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:181136:15"/>vnto his wife, that he came home. Shee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this newes, did not beleeue it at the firſt, but ſaid: Who hath power to put of the gyues with the which I left him fettered: herewithall came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a yong man theire ſeruant who told them; <hi>Adrian</hi> came home free and diſcharged. She ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that he had yeelded, and now fled to eſcape Martirdome, was much troubled in mind, &amp; began to weep: and when shee ſawe him to approch the gate of the houſe, shee threw her ſowing work (which shee had in her hands) on the ground, and running, locked the gate faſt and ſaid: I will not haue any thing to do with this vile &amp; baſe daſtarly coward, that hath returned back, and forſaken the good way he had begon, and much les will I ſee him with mine eies: I will not heare him ſpeak word vnto me, neither will I liſten to that tounge, which hath dealt deceitfully in the ſight of his Creator.</p>
               <p>When he came ſome what neerer, shee held the gate shut very cloſe all the while: and ſaid vnto him: O man of all men moſt miſcreant, and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; what hath enforced thee to begin that courſe, which thou wilt not accomplishe? who is he that hath gotten thee out of the ſociety of the bleſſed men, with whom I left thee? who hath deceiued thee, and made thee to depart out of the company of peace and perpetually ioy? Tellme, tellmee wherfore haſt thou tourned thy back, and fled before the conflict begin? Wherefore doeſt thou caſt downe thy armour on the ground like a daſtard, before thou ſaweſt thy enemy come to aſſaile thee? wherfore doeſt thou enroll thy name
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:181136:16"/>among the wounded men, before there be a ſword drawen, or arrowe shot? what shall I do, wretch that I am? who was he that ioyned me to a faithles perſon? I haue not deſerued to be the wife of a martir; nay, nowe I shalbe called the wife of a Renegate. A ſmall time endured my ioye and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and long shall laſt my shame and reproche.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Adrian</hi> ſtaied with out the gate, very glad to heare his wife ſay thes things? wherfore he ſaid vnto her: <hi>Natalia</hi> my ſiſter, open me the dore, for I do not fly to eſcape death, as thou thinkeſt, but come to call thee, that thou maieſt be preſent at our martirdome, as I haue heretofore promiſed thee. <hi>Natalia</hi> did not beleiue him, but rather called him deceiuer. He auerred earneſtly vnto her, that his words were truth, and that if shee would not open the gate quickly, he would returne vnto the priſon, that he might keepe his word, and not be depriued of the crowne of martirdome. <hi>Natalia</hi> gaue him then credit, and opened the gate, and fell humbly at his feet, and he embraced her, and then both of them returned back vnto the Iaile.</p>
               <p>By the way S. <hi>Adrian</hi> ſaid vnto his wife <hi>Natalia.</hi> Tell me my deareſt, what order haſt thou taken with thy goodes and patrymony, leſt after my death all be confiſcated and taken from the? <hi>Natalia</hi> made anſwere: my lord and husband, take no thought for the temporall and tranſitory goodes, leſt they do captiuate thy hart and deſire. Call to thy remembrance, and reuolue in thy mind, the goodes that be permanent and euerlaſting, vnto which thou draweſt nere to be partaker, together with the other holy men, in whoſe company thou
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:181136:16"/>doeſt deſire to dy for the loue of IESVS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>They both being come vnto the priſon, all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that <hi>Adrian</hi> would returne, for they were aſſured, that he came back to his death. Then did <hi>Maximian</hi> comand: that all the Chriſtian priſoners should be brought forth before him. Some came with ther flesh wounded &amp; putrefied; for in thoſe places where their Irons and gyues had bene, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were engendred, as was apparant to be ſeene. <hi>Natalia</hi> came cloſe vnto her huſband, and said vnto him; Be carefull, my lord, that thy ſoule be firme &amp; ſtable in God: beware thy hart doth nor wauer, when they preſent the tortures before thy corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſight: The preſent troubles shall endure for a ſmall time, but the guerdon, and the beatitude shall endure for euer.</p>
               <p>The Emperour looked firſt vpon <hi>Adrian,</hi> and ſaid vnto him: wilt thou continue ſtill in thy folly? The bleſſed man anſwered: I am prepared to giue my life for this which thou calleſt folly. <hi>Maximian</hi> tooke ſuch indignation at this anſwere, that he cauſed him in his owne ſight, to be ſtripped out of his clothes, and to be cruelly ſcourged. The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere were tired, and changed they were, firſt one, and then another, but the tirant was not tired, but bid them ſcourge the holy martir in cruell ſort; and no leſſe the martir ſtroue to tollerat the torment, with a reſolute mind and greate patience.</p>
               <p>Oh that one had then ſeene <hi>Natalia,</hi> howe often the collour chaunged in her face: ſometimes shee feared, that her husband should yeld, and shrink at the cruelty of the torments, and then shee was pale as a clothe, but when shee ſawe him endure all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:181136:17"/>conſtantly and courageouſly, her liuely and chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full colloure returned into her face. Sometimes <hi>Adrian</hi> looked toward her, and though nothing shee ſaid, yet only by her countenance he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, howe shee bad him be valliant, and reſolute, and to haue conſideration that the more the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts encreaſed, ſo much greater should his reward be. The holy martir was beaten with ſuch cruelty, that they hauing torne and rent his flesh, and laid his ribbes open to the view, might alſo ſee vnto his bowels.</p>
               <p>The tirant nowe weary to ſee any more vſed on that fashion, at that time, commanded him into the ſame priſon, where he was before, in which place he remained certain daies in the company of the other Chriſtians, who had endured the ſame tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuffered the ſame moleſtation, as he had done. After this <hi>Maximian</hi> cauſed them to be ageine preſented vnto him, in the place of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The martirs were taken out of the dark pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where thy were brought vnto that ſtate, that it affrighted men, and moued them to compaſſion, to behold them, yet they remained conſtant, (as before) in the faith of IESVS CHRIST. The ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant commaunded the bones of all their legges to be broken to shiuers, and one of the hands of St <hi>Adrian</hi> to be cut of. The holy martirs in this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed from this vnto a better life, euen as they made their prayers vnto our Lord.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Maximian</hi> gaue commaundement, that their bodies should be burned, and whileſt the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, hauing already gotten all their bodies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, prepared to performe it, and had laid wood

               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Gorgonius</hi> was borne in the city of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media,</hi> and was chamberlein vnto themperour <hi>Deocleſian.</hi> This man hauing receiued the faith of CHRIST IESVS by the meanes of <hi>Dorotheus</hi> his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe &amp; companion in the ſame office, Theſe two conferred what they might do, to get others of the Emperours chamber, to be made Chriſtians. It fell out that one day one <hi>Petrus</hi> that had receaued alſo the chriſtian faith, who was a man noble in bloud, &amp; of high eſteeme in themperours Court, haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g an honorable office in the ſame, ſawe in the city of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia,</hi> in the high ſtreet, and edict or proclamation ſet vp which was made againſt the Chriſtians, thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atning death and torments to them that should be diſcouered.</p>
               <p>This man vpon a greate zeale of our faith took downe the edict, and in the ſight of all the people, rent it in pieces. when this happened, <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> (whom the former had choſen to be his colleague and companion in the Empire, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:181136:19"/>had giuen vnto him the title of <hi>Ceſar</hi> were both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and vnto them it was tould, what <hi>Petrus</hi> had done, wherat both enraged and mad with fury, commanded he should be brought before theire preſence. When he was brought, (and the other two alſo being there preſent,) he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and reuiled <hi>Peter</hi> out of meaſure, and gaue ſtrict commaundment, he should not be fauored in his torments; which although they were exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, yet did he neuer showe in his countenaunce any ſigne, but of ioy, and neuer ſpoke word, but it declared a vallerous and inuincible mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gorgonius</hi> was preſent at this ſpectacle, for he and <hi>Dorotheus</hi> had bene inſtructors of <hi>Peter</hi> in the faith of CHRIST. Theſe two ſeeing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy of the B. martir, there grewe in them alſo a deſire to die for the loue of IESVS CHRIST (this his example working much in them) and by accord betwene them, they ſpoke vnto the Emperour in this maner: what meaneſt thou, o Emperour, that thou tormenteſt <hi>Peter</hi> only for that thing, in which if it be in him any fault, we alſo are culpable? if thou putteſt him to the endurance of theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe he profeſſeth the faith of IESVS CHRIST, the ſame faith we confeſſe alſo: The ſame intention he hath, we haue alſo, therfore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon willeth, that thou putteſt vs vnto the ſame torments, which thou haſt made him to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>when <hi>Diocleſian</hi> heard them ſay this: he grewe into gret choller: The loue he bore towards them before, was not ſo greate, and the deſire to do them good, as was nowe the indignation he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt them, and the determination he had to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:181136:19"/>handle them euill, and in his fury and rage he ſaid vnto them: Since you ſeek the way like fooles (as this man is) to be tormented, you shall haue your minds ſatisfied. Then he commaunded they should be ſcourged without pitty, which was performed forthwith, ſo that their flesh was rent and torne in diuers places. Then the tirant commaunded the officers to lay ſalt, and power vineger into their wounds, and lay them on the gridiron, and vnder it a fire to be made, but not a greate one, to put them to the more torment.</p>
               <p>Peter was nowe dead by this martirdome, and bicauſe <hi>Gorgonius</hi> and <hi>Dorotheus</hi> ſemed yet to liue, and the tirant was wearied to ſee their torment vpon the gridiron, he made them to be taken from it, and with a rope tied aboute their necks to be hanged, by which meanes the two holy martirs rendered vp their ſoules vnto their Creator. Their bodies being taken away, were buried by ſome Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Diocleſian</hi> vnderſtanding, that the Chriſtians came ſecretly to make their praiers at the place, where the holy martirs were buried, cauſed their bodies to be taken out of their graues, and to be thrown into the ſea. At ſuch time, as <hi>Diocleſian</hi> commaunded it, he ſaid: Let them be caſt into a place, where they may be no more ſeen leaſt they be accounted for gods by the Chriſtians, who are ſo ignorant, that they do think it better to adore them that haue been our ſeruants, then thoſe whom we adore for our gods.</p>
               <p>God Almighty did not permit thoſe bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to ly hidden, but rather his pleaſure was, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:181136:20"/>cauſe the ſea to do them honour, and to bring them vnto the shore. When the Chriſtians ſawe them, they tooke them vp with reuerence, and buried them in a place vnknowen vnto the pagans. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in proceſſe of time, the body of S. <hi>Gorgonius</hi> was caried vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and was buried in the way called <hi>Lauicana,</hi> betwen the two bay trees.

                  <hi>But omitting the examples and teſtimonies of the holy ſcriptures, which make this thing an Article of faith, we haue moſt euident examples in many holy ſaints, vnto whom God graunted many fauors and graces (which they requeſted of him) not only in their life time, in this world, but alſo after their paſſing into heauen, to poſſeſſe the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glorie. One of theſe was</hi> S.

His life was written by</hi> S. Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Archibishop <hi>of</hi> Florence, <hi>and by a relligious man of his order, in this maner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Nicholas</hi> was borne in the <hi>Marcha d' Ancona</hi> in a village called <hi>S. Angelo,</hi> in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie of <hi>Fermo.</hi> His father was called <hi>Compagnone</hi> and his mother <hi>Amata.</hi> Theſe two were borne of noble bloud, rich they were, and good Chriſtians, but they liued in ſome diſcontent, for that hauing bene married together a good ſpace, they had yet no children: They had a particuler deuotion vnto <hi>S. Nicholas</hi> the Bishop and Confeſſor, and him they beſought continually that he would of God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that fauor for them, that they might haue a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:181136:21"/>fruit of benediction. With this entent they went to viſite his church in the city of <hi>Bari</hi> in <hi>Puglia.</hi> In that place, the holy ſaint appeared vnto them, and did aſſure them, that they should haue a ſonne, whom thy should name <hi>Nicholas</hi> after him, and alſo that he should be a bleſſed ſeruant of God.</p>
               <p>Euery thing fell out iuſt, as the Saint ſaid: for the being returned home, <hi>Amata</hi> conceiued, and at her due time brought forth a ſonne, whom they called <hi>Nicholas:</hi> and as he tooke his name of S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Bishop and Confeſſor, by whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion he was obteined, euen ſo he was like vnto him in many things. From a child, he was inclined to ſerue God, he frequented the Church, he hard maſſe and praied with greate deuotion, moreouer, he faſted, gaue almes and followed his ſtudy, ſo that as he encreaſed in age, euen ſo he did in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, learning, and ſcience. and to be short, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be a man of the Church.</p>
               <p>He was already made a chanon of the church of S. <hi>Sauiour,</hi> in the place where he dwelt, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that a worthy and renowned father of the order of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> came thither to preach. One day among others, <hi>Nicholas</hi> was at the ſermon, in the which the preacher expounded theſe wordes of S.<note place="margin">Iohn <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Iohn: Do not you loue the world, nor the things, that be therin,</hi> The preacher ſpoke ſuch good matter vpon that text, that <hi>Nicholas</hi> reſolued to abandon the world, and to take the habite of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in that ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent, where the ſaid preacher dwelt with whom he had bene acquainted before that time. When he entended to execute in deed the reſolution he had made before time, he asked
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:181136:21"/>leaue of his father and mother, who though they were aggriued to want the ſight of their ſonne, yet did they giue him licence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicholas</hi> went vnto the conuent of <hi>Tolentinum,</hi> to craue the habite of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which was giuen him readily, for they had before then notice of his good life. Hauing receiued the habite, he proceeded from vertue to vertue, labouring to atteine vnto perfection. So that being a relligious man, he was a mirrour for other relligious men, and being a prieſt, he was a looking glaſſe for other prieſts, and when he was a preacher, a ſpectacle for other preachers, to behold their duety and function. In this holy ſaint, among other vertues, his abſtinence shined moſt clearly: for in. 30. years ſpace, that he continewed in the conuent of <hi>Tolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinum,</hi> he did neuer eat flesh, eggs, fish, milk, nor any thing made with milk.</p>
               <p>He fell one time into a greuous infirmity, which brought him vnto deaths dore, wherupon the phiſitions told him; that if he would recouer his health, he muſt eat flesh, wherunto he anſwered: that in ſo doing, he should, by deſiring to auoid one danger, fall into another, and that in flieng the infirmity of the body, he should incurre the malady of his ſoule, by giuing liberty vnto his ſenſuallity and appetite. The prior of the conuent ſeeing the phiſitions to affirme, that it was neceſſary for the bleſſed man <hi>Nicholas</hi> to eate flesh, commaunded him in the vertue of holy obedience, to eate ſome. He, without any reply, bad the meat which he should eate, to be brought vnto him.</p>
               <p>There was brought vnto him, (as it is ſaid) a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:181136:22"/>boiled chicken, or ſome other foule, whatſoeuer it was, and the bleſſed man hauing it before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought our lord to do him that fauour, that he might not eat of that foule, and yet not to runne into the ſinne of diſobedience: wherupon the foule returned vnto life, and flewe away out of the platter, leauing all them that were preſent aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and the holy ſaint iocund and glad.</p>
               <p>On the next night, the B. Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> viſited him, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious virgin bad him to ſend for a loafe of bread into the market place, and to put it in water, and to eate therof, in the name of IESVS CHRIST: and he should be cured of that infirmity. Herof cometh the vſage, that the bread, which is called the <hi>breade of</hi> S. <hi>Nicholas of Tolentino,</hi> is bleſſed on that day in the conuents of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that his feaſt is ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed, and this breade helpeth, and cureth many infirmities, as is to this day ſeene by experience, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the feuer tercian, which was his infirmitie as is thought.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> being healed, and cured of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid infirmity, returned vnto his accuſtomed pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and auſterity of life; he vſed to faſt three daies in the week, which he had obſerued from the age of ſeuen years. He whipped himſelfe in the night many times, and his diſcipline or whippe was certein chaines of Iron: his bed was made with a litle hay, and his habite was of courſe cloth, full of pieces; he vſed to pray very much, for he continued in his oraiſons from the houre of the Complin, vntill it was farre in the night, and from the houre of mattins vntill maſſe was celebrated,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:181136:22"/>and from the houre of None vntill the euenſong.</p>
               <p>The bleſſed man ſpending his time in theſe, and other like good exerciſes, was much vexed and molleſted by the diuell, who endeuored to drawe him from theſe his holy imploymentes, by ſcoffs and deceits, and ſometimes (by the permiſſion of God) by tormenting and beating him, in ſuch ſort, that the friers hearing the noiſe came forthwith to defend him, and they found him laid at length vpon the ground, like a dead man, and ſo they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him back vnto his couch of hay, and, yet he for al this omitted not his prayers. He viſited ſick men with great charity, and endeuored to help and cherish them, as much as he was able. He had greate compaſſion vpon ſome ſinners which had made their confeſſion vnto him, and for them he praied, faſted, and ſaid maſſe with greate deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The like he did for the ſoules in purgatory, vnto the which he had greate deuotion, which was increaſed much more in him by a reuelation he had, of the great paines they ſuffered in that place. when there came any frier as a ſtranger vnto his conuent, he shewed him all the kindnes, he could poſſibly, neither did he forget the ſtate of priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but rather in his ſermons, and priuate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, which he had with rich men, and men in autority, he perſuaded them to the works of mercy, as a thing very acceptable vnto our lord. This bleſſed Saint comforted the afflicted, gaue conſolation vnto men in tribulation, ſet atonement betwene men, that were at variance: He was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for them, that were in affliction, a helper vnto
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:181136:23"/>the needy, and the raunſomer of them that were ſlaues and in bondage.</p>
               <p>God shewed many miracles by the meanes of this glorious ſaint, aſwell in his life time, as alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, which be fell him in the afore ſaid conuent of <hi>Tolentine.</hi> and when he was now at the laſt gaſp, he called the friers, and deſired them all to forgiue him, if he had offended them in any thing: and after he had receiued the moſt holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, he cauſed a crucifix to be ſet before him, and in ſpeaking vnto CHRIST, his <hi>B.

Philoſophy was their chiefeſt ſtudy, and by ſpeculation in the ſame, thy came to knowe that it was a foolish and vaine thing to adore many Gods, for reaſon did make demonſtration, that ſuch wicked, and lewd men as were <hi>Iupiter, Apollo, Mars,</hi> and all the other, which the heathens adored for Gods, were not only vnworthy of the name of God, but alſo of men, ſince their deeds and actions were beſtiall and abhominable.</p>
               <p>After this, beginning to frequent the company of chriſtians, they had vnderſtanding of the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our faith, and ſo deſired to be baptized: To performe this the better, <hi>Eugenia</hi> determined to put her ſelf in mans apparell, and in that ſort to depart
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:181136:24"/>from her fathers houſe, taking with her <hi>Prothus</hi> and <hi>Iacinthus</hi> the Eunuches, to ſeek out a holy Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot called <hi>Helenus,</hi> to be by him Baptiſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into his ſociety. This Abbot gouerned a monaſtery of relligious men, and had a reuelation that <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſo called was a woeman, yet becauſe he knew it, to be the wil of God, that things should proceed in that maner, he kept it from her. He Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed them and gaue vnto them all three his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious habitt, and they liued therin a godly &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life: Afterward <hi>Helenus</hi> the Abbot deceaſing, the monks, who thought <hi>Eugenius</hi> had bene a man, choſe hir for their Abbot. Who was vnwilling to take the charge on her, but the entreaty of the monks who were much pleaſed with hir holy life preuailed.</p>
               <p>There was in <hi>Alexandria</hi> a matrone called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantia,</hi> who had bin cured and healed of a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, by the praiers of <hi>Eugenius</hi> who adiudged her to be a man. <hi>Eugenius</hi> went oft vnto her houſe at her importunate inuitations. The matrone was indeed ennamoured of her, and they two being alone, without any regard of her eſtate or credit laid open her loue imagining her to be a man. <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> sharply reproued her, and ſo departed and left hir alone. <hi>Melantia</hi> ſeing her ſelf contemned and refuſed, like the miſtris of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> shricked out, and ſaid:<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note> that the Abbot <hi>Eugenius</hi> would haue forced her: And not content with that, did alſo accuſe her falſely vnto the Gouernor, who was the father of <hi>Eugenia.</hi> The Regent hauing heard the accuſation of <hi>Melania</hi> commanded the Abbot <hi>Eugenius</hi> to be brought in before him. When the bleſſed Saint
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:181136:24"/>vnderſtood the cauſe wherefore shee was called, she tooke thhe Eunuchs <hi>Protus</hi> and <hi>Iacinctus</hi> in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of religious men with her, being come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Philip</hi> her father, he vſed rough words and asked them if CHRIST their God counſelled them to force honorable Ladies?</p>
               <p>The virgin with a modeſt and cherefull face ſaid: <hi>There is time to be ſilent, and a time to ſpeak.</hi>

Now thou shalt ſee the verity of this womans acuſation. Hauing ſaith this, she rent her habite before her breaſt, and opened it, that euery one might ſee by her breaſtes that she was a woman. Then she proceeded, and told him that she was <hi>Eugenia</hi> his daughter and moreouer she ſpake ſo well vnto hir father, that he was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the faith of CHRIST, and ſo was <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> his wife, and all the reſt of his family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> gaue vp his office and place, and not long after was choſen Bishop: and afterward in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution raiſed by the Emperours <hi>Valerian</hi> and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyen</hi> he was martired. <hi>Claudia, Eugenia, Prothus</hi> and <hi>Iacinctus,</hi> returned vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> where by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the holy damoſell <hi>Eugenia</hi> and of the two holy Eunuches <hi>Protus</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacinctus,</hi> many were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto the faith of CHRIST. <hi>Gallien</hi> being certified herof, cauſed <hi>Eugenia</hi> to be apprehended, &amp; after the indurance of many torments to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headded. Then he cauſed the two Eunuchs <hi>Prothus</hi> and <hi>Iacinctus</hi> to be taken and hauing vſed ſundry enducements to moue them to ſacrifice vnto the

               </p>
               <p>OVR Lord God deſiring to be ſerued, and not to be offended by men, ſeing their condition, and ſeuerall eſtates, and that ſome be noble, and to be dealt with all mildly, and that others be rude, and are to be handled roughly, he gaue premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions vnto them, to the end they should not lament nor complaine of him, as if they had not ben warned. He talking with the Hebrewes (as we reade in <hi>Leuiticus</hi>) ſaid to them:<note place="margin">Leuit. <hi>26.</hi>
                  </note> If you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue my commaundements, among other good and profit you shall reap therby, one shalbe this: that if you haue enemies that moleſt and make warre on you, five of you shall put a. 100. of them to flight, and a. 100. of you shall put to flight. 10000. of them. But if on the other ſide you shalbe diſobedienr to me, a fewe, of your enemies shall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:181136:26"/>make many of you to fly, and that in dread and feare though none purſue you.</p>
               <p>This which God ſaid then vnto the people, was apparant and ſeen (as we read in the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi>) where it is ſaid:<note place="margin">Ioſ. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> that the Hebrues hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiged <hi>Iericho</hi> certein daies, finally they took it, without drawing their ſword, bicauſe the walles fell downe, and they which were within, made no reſiſtance, all was put to the fire and ſword, not ſparing any thing, for ſo God had comaunded, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his indignation was kindled againſt that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as alſo to terrify his other enemies. It came to paſſe in the pilling therof, that there came to the hands of a ſouldier called <hi>Achan</hi> a ſcarlet robe, ſome mony, and a wand or rod of gold: which things he kept againſt the commaundement of God. And to be more ſecure he hid them all in the ground.</p>
               <p>This being done, part of the army diſlodged, and went to fight againſt <hi>Hay,</hi> the citiſens wherof iſſued out and encountred with them; and preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led killing many Iſraelites, and fewe returned with this dolefull newes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſua</hi> generall of the hoſt, ſeing the ſame, fell on the ground, and weeping ſaid vnto God: Howe happeneth it, o Lord: be theſe thy promiſes? Doth it ſeeme to thee a iuſt thing, to haue thy people ſo euil entreated by thine enemies? Aſſoone as we be entred into this countrey, to conquer it why doſt thou giue ſuch forces to our aduerſaries? This shal be an occaſion that others shall take courage, and it shalbe a hard thing to ſubiect them. God anſwered <hi>Ioſua:</hi> that this happened through the fault of the people them ſelues hauing broken his precept, in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:181136:26"/>reſeruing ſome things in the deſtruction of the city. Therefore ſeeke out the culpable, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and let him be chaſtiſed, and my iuſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall ceaſe. Aſſone as <hi>Ioſua</hi> had by enquiry found him out, he cauſed him to be punished, and the people did after that preuaile againſt their enemies.</p>
               <p>By this you may ſee, that when Catholiques are ouercome, and vanquished, it happeneth; bicauſe God is offended with them for their ſinnes. we ought there fore haue this regard euer when warre is made againſt infidells: if we intend and deſire to haue victory, that wee be in good eſtate and accord with God, by confeſſing our ſinnes, doing penance, and receiuing the B. Sacrament of the Aultar, and without doubt, then a fewe Chriſtians wilbe able to reſiſt many Infidels.</p>
               <p>As it befell to Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> 4. in the yeare of our Lord. 854. who being certified, that there was diſembarqued or landed at <hi>Oſtia</hi> a great nomber of Infidels, and that no captein durſt affront them, The glorious Pope aſſembled people, and ſaid; he himſelfe would be generall of the Army. And that he might ſet on, and encounter with his enemies more ſecurely, he enioyned all the ſouldiers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſinnes, and to receiue the B. ſacrament: he alſo comaunded eache one, in the one hand to cary their weapons for the warre, and in the other hand, the <hi>Roſary,</hi> to ſay their praiers in the way. Arriuing after this manner, in the ſight of the enemy, notwithſtanding the huge number of the Infidels, and the ſmall hoſt of the Chriſtians, he diſcomfited them, and droue them out of <hi>Italy,</hi> to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:181136:27"/>the great honoure of the valiant Bishop, and good and benefitt of all Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>All this may be fitly applied vnto that, which befell in the time of themperour <hi>Heraclius.</hi> for that the ſinnes of the Criſtians were many and heinous (<hi>Phocas</hi> ruling the Gretian empire, who was a vitious man, and ſo he died, for <hi>Heraclius</hi> depriued him of thempire, &amp; of his life alſo) God permitted a tirant called <hi>Coſdroes</hi> king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as a greuous ſcourge to riſe againſt them. He being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to haue taken by force of armes the holly city of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and to haue ſacked it, caried away the holy croſſe, (on the which IESVS CHRIST died, which had bin there, from the time of <hi>Helena</hi> the mother of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who found it) into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and put it in the temple of one of his Idols: and againe he inuaded the lands of the Chriſtians with a new army, were he vſed horrible cruelties.</p>
               <p>With fury he paſſed into <hi>Egipt,</hi> &amp; wonne the city of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in which place he ſtayed certein daies, for that he vnder ſtood <hi>Heraclianus</hi> father to themperour <hi>Heraclius</hi> came againſt him with a huge hoſt, but by the ſecrete iudgment of God <hi>Heraclia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> died of ſicknes, and his army was vtterly defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The proud <hi>Coſdroes</hi> proceeded, and in fewe daies made him ſelf lord of all the dominons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had in <hi>Africa:</hi> he ſacchegged <hi>Thunis,</hi> and hauing vſed horrible maſſacres of Chriſtians, he returned into his kingdome of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Heraclius</hi> all this wile remained in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> ſpendnig the time in iollity and pleaſures, hauing taken to wife a beautifull lady
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:181136:27"/>called <hi>Martina,</hi> who was his coſin, but when he ſawe things go a way, to his greate reproch and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, and fearing greater loſſe might enſue in th'empire, firſt, he tried to obteine a peace by low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and humble embaſſages, and vpon conditions no leſſe reprochfull then diſauantageous for his eſtate; but the arrogant infidell, proud of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, would giue no eare to his peticions, but ſent a meſſenger to ſay, that he would make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with him, except he would deny the faith of IESVS CHRIST, and become an Idolater as he him ſelf was.</p>
               <p>This proud anſwer, and blaſphemy, did ſo exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the Chriſtian Emperour, that he became an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other man, &amp; was altered from a negligent and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reles perſon, to a couragious and enkindled with a godly zeale: And being deſirous to take on him the defence of Gods honour, he behaued himſelf as a valiant prince, &amp; a Catholique and good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Firſt, he aſſembled his forces very diligently, that he might come to try it with that proud pagan by dint of word, and alſo amaſſed greate ſtore of men, engines, and other prouiſions for the warre; and commaunded, that in all the empire proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and praiers should be made, to beſeech God to take the defence of his church, and to punish the proud blaſphemy of the preſumptuous tirant againſt his heauenly maieſty.</p>
               <p>Heraclius departed from Conſtantinople, toward this pious and holy interpriſe, carying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais in his right hand the Image of IESVS CHRIST our Lord, and of his glorious mother, as his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein (and the report was, the the ſame Image
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:181136:28"/>was brought from heauen) and paſſing from thence the ſea with a goodly company, he entred into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to affront the proud enemy, who when he vnderſtood that themperour with a mighty army came to ſeeke him, was aduiſed to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his perſon; ſo he retired to a ſtrong and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure place, and left his army guided by valorous generals, to defend the countreis he had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and his owne alſo. There happened in this warre (which laſted litle leſſe then ſixe yeares) many greate and notable feats of armes.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of all was, that they fought in three ſet battailes: The firſt was in the paſſage of the mount <hi>Taurus</hi> and the ryuer <hi>Saron.</hi> and in this <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius</hi> diſcomfited and put to flight <hi>Saluarus</hi> one of the chiefeſt capteines of <hi>Coſdroes.</hi> The ſecond pitcht field was, in the next yeare, with <hi>Satinus</hi> who was another valiant captaine, &amp; the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was very terrible, for the Perſians fought ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recouer the honour they had loſt in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer battaile ſo that <hi>Heraclius</hi> was in great daunger. The Chriſtians were reſolued to leaue the field, and to fly; when it pleaſed God to heare the praier of his champion <hi>Heraclius:</hi> for vnlooked for, there fell from heauen a greate shower of raine with a ſtorme, which driuen with a ſtrong wind, carried the raine into the face of the pagans, and depriued them of their ſight, in ſuch ſort, that they not being able to fight began to fly, which the Imperials ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tooke hart, beholding God apparantly to fight on their ſide: and thus they obteined the ſecond victory, which was more greate then the firſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in the yere following, <hi>Heraclius</hi> returned
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:181136:28"/>into the field, to encounter with <hi>Razatanes</hi> the moſt valiant captain <hi>Coſdroes</hi> had: and therin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour behaued himſelfe ſo valiantly, that he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defeated and daunted the pride of the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and cruell king <hi>Coſdroes,</hi> who was enforced by theſe ouerthrows to retire himſelf vnto the moſt ſtrong and ſecure places of his kingdome of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This his fearefull retreate cauſed his vtter ruine. For thinking he had left ſufficient forces on the frontiers of his realme, to keepe his enemies from entrance, he made <hi>Medarſes</hi> his yonger ſonne his heire and ſucceſſor in his kingdome, and put him in poſſeſſion therof, and aſſigned him to ſtay on the frontiers for the more ſure garde and defence therof, and to keep the Imperialls from entring therin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coſdroes</hi> had another ſonne elder then <hi>Medarſes,</hi> called <hi>Siricheus, o Sirus</hi> (as ſome call him) who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ſucceede his father in the kingdome (as his right and proweſſe alſo deſerued) who took ſuch indignation at his fathers doing, that he diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to depriue him of his crowne: &amp; that he might with more facility bring his purpoſes to paſſe, he determined to make a ſecret accord with <hi>Heraclius,</hi> which was concluded vpon theſe articles: That he should deliuer vnto themperour <hi>Heraclius</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and brethren, either aliue or deade: and alſo the Croſſe of our Lord IESVS CHRIST: and ſet free out of priſon <hi>Zacharias</hi> the patriarch of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> That he should reſtore all that which <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droes</hi> had taken from thence: And that he should haue the realme of <hi>Perſia</hi> for himſelf, and that he should keepe perpetuall peace with the Chriſtians.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:181136:29"/>All theſe couenants were performed. For by the aide of them of his faction, and the aide <hi>Heraclius</hi> ſent, he was made king, and put his father and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to death, he reſtored the holy Croſſe, ſet the patriarch free, and performed all the couenants compriſed in the peace.</p>
               <p>Th'emperor <hi>Heraclius,</hi> deſirous to render thanks vnto God for the benefits receaued, and alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Holy Croſſe vnto the place, where it ought to ſtand, went on proceſſion. In the which <hi>Heraclius</hi> was clothed in moſt gorgeous apparell, and with shoes embrodered with perles and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones: and in this manner he carried the holy Croſſe, as in imitation of IESVS CHRIST:</p>
               <p>It happened that when he should enter the gate of the city to go vnto <hi>Mount Caluary,</hi> (I ſay enter,<note place="margin">Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card: de terra ſancta p. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> §. <hi>43.</hi>

               <p>The patriark <hi>Zacharias</hi> came neere vnto th'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and ſaid: I am in dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Petronilla</hi> the daughter of S. <hi>Peter</hi> being in <hi>Rome,</hi> was ſeene by the gouernour of the city, who was enamored of her. And though that he was a man in chief autority, yet went he vnto the houſe of the holy ſaint, with a great troope of gentlemen, and gaue her to vnderſtand, that he loued her, and deſired to marry her, and make her his wife. <hi>Petronilla</hi> ſeing <hi>Flaccus,</hi> (for that was his name) to be a man of great power, douted he would vſe violence, and therefore shaped him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:181136:30"/>me thinke it is not a thing conuenient, to come and ſpeak vnto a damoſell (liuing alone, as I do) with ſuch a crewe, eſpecially in ſuch a matter as of loue; as though thou wouldſt obteine me more by conſtraint, then by loue. I should be thought a foole and vnwiſe if I would forſak ſuch an honorable perſon as thy ſelf, that ſueth to mary me, and take any other to my husband: wherfore my Lord, I beſeech thee to ſend vnto me ſome matrone or damſells, to ſtay &amp; remaine three daies with me, after which time I will come vnto thy houſe, and the wedding shall be made as thou deſireſt.</p>
               <p>This her requeſt contented the gouernour fully, and ſo he departed, with intent to performe her deſire. <hi>Petronilla</hi> had a maid ſeruant called <hi>Felicula,</hi> who was a Chriſtian and very vertuous, and vnto her <hi>Petronilla</hi> vttered her mind in gret familiarity, and beſought her to aſſiſt her in her praiers vnto God, that with in three daies God would be pleaſed to take her out of this life. <hi>Felicula</hi> at the requeſt of her miſtris, was content to do it. So they two faſted and prayed all thoſe three daies, and did other works acceptable vnto God.</p>
               <p>On the third day there came vnto them a prieſt and ſeruant of God, dwelling in <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes;</hi> who ſaid maſſe, and gaue them the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. S. <hi>Petronilla</hi> hauing communicated, began a long and feruent ſpeech vnto IESVS CHRIST, ſaieng: that she had offered her virginity vnto him, with a perpetuall vow; and therfore deſired him not to permit it to be violated againſt her will. S. <hi>Felicula</hi> alſo as a true friend, aided her, importuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<pb n="56" facs="tcp:181136:31"/>our Lord, to deliuer his handmaid out of that danger; though she deſired not her death. It was Gods pleaſure to giue <hi>Petronilla</hi> remedy by that means; for hauing ended her oraiſons, she went vnto bed, and yelded vp her ſoule vnto God. The matrones and damſells <hi>Flaccus</hi> had ſent, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the ſpouſe vnto his houſe on the wedding day, came in god time to ſolemniſe the funeralls of the holy ſaint.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Flaccus</hi> was certefied, and ſawe <hi>Petronilla</hi> to be dead, he caſt his eies vpon <hi>Felicula</hi> (who was very ſorowfull, for the death of her friend) being very beutifull, which drew the affection of <hi>Flaccus</hi> in ſuch ſort, that he was enamored of her alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after many wordes he vſed to that purpoſe he finished his ſpeach thus: <hi>Felicula,</hi> elect one of thes two things, pleaſe thy ſelf either to be my wife, or els ſacrifice vnto the Gods. The good damſell made him this bold anſwere: I will not be thy wife, for I haue IESVS CHRIST to my ſpouſe, and I will not ſacrifice vnto thy Gods, for that I am a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> when <hi>Flaccus</hi> hard the reſolute anſwere of <hi>Felicula,</hi> he deliuered her into the hands of the liuetenant to giue iudgment vpon her. He kept her faſt in a dark roome for ſeuen daies, and beſide other vexations he kept her from any ſuſtenance.</p>
               <p>Some women that belonged vnto the priſon, ſaid vnto her: Alas poore girle, why art thou ſo fond, as to dy willingly this euill death? Take this great Lord vnto thy husband, who is beutifull, riche, and in the flower of his youth, and highly fauored of th'emperor, who hath made him gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this city: other women would haue ben
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:181136:31"/>right glad therof, and thou makeſt no account of him, which may turne to thy damage and loſſe of life. The bleſſed damoſell replied: I am the ſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, and I will not mary any other but him.</p>
               <p>After that ſeuen daies expired, <hi>Felicula</hi> was led vnto the <hi>Veſtall</hi> virgins, where she remanied cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein daies, but she would neuer eate of the meat that they did eate, bicauſe it was offered and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed vnto the goddeſſe <hi>Veſta;</hi> for if she had eaten therof, she had giuen a ſigne to conſent vnto their Idolatry, and other Chriſtians would haue bene much ſcandaliſed therat. When the deputy vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the conſtancy of <hi>Felicula,</hi> he cauſed her to be taken out of that place, and to be tortured with the torture called <hi>Eculeus,</hi> and when she was torti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there with, she ſaid with a loud voice: Now do I ſee my beloued IESVS CHRIST, vpon whom I haue fixed my loue.</p>
               <p>The excutioners ſaid vnto her; Say, that thou art not a Chriſtian, and thou shalt be deliuered from this torture: She anſwered: I do not deny, neither will I deny my beloued IESVS CHRIST, who for my ſake was crowned with thornes; and had gall giuen him, for drink; and alſo died on the Croſſe. The executioners tooke her of from that torment, and threw her in a gutter or ſink, in the which the bleſſed damoſell yelded vp her ſoule vnto Almighty God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flaccus</hi> being told, what <hi>Nicomedes</hi> had done, cauſed him to be apprehended for the ſame, and being inſtigated by the fiend, willed him to ſacrifice vnto the gods. The good prieſt ſaid he would not ſacrifice to any, but to Almightie God, that raigned in the heauens; for that they whom they reputed gods, were no other, but ſtocks and ſtones, which remained in their temples, like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
               <p>The gouernour commaunded he should be whipped, which was done with ſuch vehemency, that the good prieſt paſſed out of this vnto a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life in this torment, and his body was caſt into the riuer <hi>Tiber,</hi> by the commandement of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iudge: but one <hi>Iuſtus</hi> his ſeruant, ſought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully after it; and caried it being found vnto a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his, nere vnto the walles of the citty, in the way called <hi>Numentana,</hi> &amp; there he buried it. Vnto which place many Chriſtians reſorted, and there by the merits of that holy Saint, obteined many graces of God.</p>

               <p>But many think it was much ſooner, for if <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronilla</hi> died in the yeare of our Lord. 90. she muſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:181136:32"/>be of neceſſitie at that time 60. years old, becauſe she was borne before that our Lord gaue the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt prelacy or Papacy vnto <hi>S.

               <p>SIXE daies after S. <hi>Fabianus</hi> the pope was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired; <hi>Cornelius</hi> a man no leſſe learned then holy, was placed in the chaire of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that dignity agaiſt his will. S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> ſaith he was a Romaine,<note place="margin">Lib <hi>4.</hi> epiſt.</note> and ſonne vnto <hi>Caſtinus.</hi> When he was choſen pope, the Church was in great troubles; for beſide the temporall ſword where with the Chriſtians were sharply afflicted, they were encombred alſo with the treacherous hereſie of <hi>Nouatus,</hi> which they could not wholly root out: yet this bleſſed pope <hi>Cornelius</hi> endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with all dilligence to confound them, by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and doctrine; by which he reduced many of thoſe hereticks to the vnion of the Catholique faith.</p>
               <p>After this, the pope (being aided by <hi>Lucina</hi> a noble Romane matron) determined to take the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:181136:33"/>bodies of SS. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> out of the <hi>Catatumbae</hi> where they then were, and to put them in a more comely, and eminent place. The bodie of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was caried vnto the poſeſſion of the aforenamed <hi>Lucina,</hi> in the <hi>Via Oſtienſis,</hi> not far from the place where he was beheaded, and there was built a ſumptuous, and magnificent church to his honour. The reliques of S. <hi>Peter</hi> were caried into the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> where in like manner was built a church, neere to the place where he was crucified. For theſe good workes, and many other which he did, as alſo, for that many pagans were conuerted vnto the faith by his meanes; <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperour banished him from <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent him to <hi>Centum-Celle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Cornelius</hi> remaining there, wrote oftentimes vnto S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> bishop of <hi>Carihage,</hi> a holy man, and very eloquent, who in like manner returned him anſweres: and at this daie, many of thoſe Epiſtles be extant in his workes.</p>

To this S. <hi>Cornelius</hi> anſwered: the letters that I haue receiued, meddle not at all with the comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welth,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:181136:34"/>neither treat of anything appertaining to the ſame; but they be wholy written in the laud, and honor of IESVS CHRIST, and of matters only appartaining to the ſaluation of ſoules. <hi>Decius</hi> was much more moued to indignation then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at this bold anſwere; and commaunded, that the bleſſed pope should be beaten in his ſight. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he apointed, that he should be led vnto the Temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> and if he refuſed to ſacrifice, that he should be beheaded.</p>
               <p>The holy Pope went with determination to ſuffer, not one, but a 1000. deathes, rather then he would deny his faith &amp; his God. By the way he met with <hi>Stephen</hi> his Archdeacon, vnto whom he gaue in charge to diſtribute the Treaſures of the church vnto the poore, and he gaue vnto him alſo ſome records, appertaining to the gouernment of the Church. When the officers perceiued, that there was no way nor meanes, to drawe S. <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to ſacrifiſe vnto the Idolls; they led him into <hi>via Appia,</hi> neere vnto the Churchyard of <hi>Calliſtus,</hi> and in that place they cut of his head. After his death, certaine prieſtes, (in the companie of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina</hi>) took vp his bodie, and buried it in a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in the <hi>San-field.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The martirdome of this holy Pope was on the 14. daie of <hi>September,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord 253. the aboue named <hi>Decius</hi> being Emperour. He held the ſeat of S. <hi>Peter</hi> 2. yeares, 2. monthes, and 3. daies. He gaue holy orders twiſe in the month of <hi>December,</hi> and therein ordered 4. Prieſts. 4. Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and 7. Bishops. There bee in the decrees cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Canons of this holy Pope, as the afore ſaid,

               <p>THOVGH the memory of <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bishop and martir of IESVS CHRIST shall endure whileſt the world laſteth, for that he wrote ſo many eloquent and learned works, yet requiſite it is, that beſide this, he should be regiſtred for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renoumed deeds, and for his moſt holy life, for the good of them that shall liue herafter. And becauſe many haue a care, to deſcribe the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirdomes, that holy men haue ſuffered for CHRISTES ſake, making therby their name immortall, it is very iuſt, that the martirdome of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> be alſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:181136:35"/>written, that his eternall memorie may be conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſince he excelled in his life, euen from the time of his conuerſion, &amp; laſtly in his martirdome. Wee need not to make any relation of his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conuerſion, becauſe it was of no regard, or eſtimation in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> was altogether giuen vnto worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he ſtudied humain letters, in the which he came to be very learned. He was a good, retoritian, and redd that ſcience publikely in <hi>Carthage,</hi> which was his natiue countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but after he was conuerted vnto God, and of an Idollater was made a beleeuer, and of a painim a chriſtian; he gaue himſelf vnto the ſtudy of diuinity, and thervnto he adioyned good works, which be very acceptable vnto God. He eſpecially reſolued to obſerue chaſtity: he ſold his patrimony and diſtributed the mony ariſing therof vnto the poore: and by this he obteined two things. Firſt: he auoided therby worldly am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, vnto which worldly riches do drawe men, that be welthy: and ſecondly; he was made perfect in vertue, aſſoone as he had knowledg therof, and knew what it was. For our Lord IESVS CHRIST, gaue this counſell vnto a yong man, that in all his life had kept the commaundements of God, and told him; that if he would be perfect, he muſt ſell all, that he had, and giue the price vnto the poore. S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> beginning to be good, deſired alſo to be perfectly good, for (as I haue ſaid) he ſold all that he had, and gaue the mony vnto the poore. This was in him conſiderable, and alſo ſtupendious, becauſe he that ſoweth, gathereth not the fruit forthwith. He that planteth a vineyard, doth not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:181136:36"/>forthwith gather grapes, he that planteth a melon or a peare, doth not by and by gather a peare or a melon. This wonder was remarkable in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> for he had not ſcarce thrown the ſeed out of his hand, but he began to reap the corne; the vineyard was vnneth planted, and yet he gathered grapes of it. So, aſſone as the tree of the word of God and of faith was planted in his ſoule, ſo ſoone were ſeen in him the fruits of holy and vertuous works.</p>
               <p>And though that the Apoſtle aduiſeth vs;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1</hi> Tim. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> that the <hi>Neophite</hi> should not be made a Bishop (to wit one that is newely conuerted from any ſect what ſoeuer, vnto true Chriſtianity) ſaying: it is not fit to beſtowe on him ſo ſoone a dignity of ſuch account, as it is to be a Bishop, leſt there should be any nouelty introduced by him into the Church of God, which might ſmell or ſauour of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme; yet this rule was not obſerued in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ciprian;</hi> for that which is wrought in other men by time, that did his great &amp; liuely faith operate in him preſently, and therefore he was made prieſt incontinent.</p>
               <p>This function he exerciſed in all ſanctity, neither did the memory of the forſaking of his goods, and to ſee him ſelf poore, any whit diſmay or hinder him. The flattering and guilefull words of his wife (which he had when he was a heathen) did not hinder him, nor the preferments and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had in the world, no not his kinsfolks nor friends were any impediment, or obſtacle vnto him. His vertue continued firme with him, being in this ſtate, becauſe it was well founded: In ſuch
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:181136:36"/>ſort,<note place="margin">Iob. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> that no temptation preuailed againſt him any whit: yea rather like another <hi>Iob,</hi> he bleſſed and praiſed God, in the depth of his tribulations.</p>
               <p>Being prieſt, he dwelt apart from others in a houſe, which was alway open for, and to the needy. Litle he could do, becauſe he was poore, but for the litle that he could, there neuer came widow, orphan, wounded, or diſcomforted perſon, that departed from him without help, ſuccour or good aduiſe.</p>
               <p>He was a gret frend of a prieſt called <hi>Cecilius,</hi> who was the man, that with his liuely reaſons, and holy admonitions had wonne him from infidelity, and had Baptiſed him, and this is the cauſe why he called himſelfe <hi>Cecilius Ciprianus,</hi> allwaies eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this prieſt as his father. Vnto this <hi>Cecilius</hi> S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> gaue and vſed meanes, wherwith to ſuſtein and maintain his wife, which he had before his conuerſion, as alſo his children, which he had by her; that is to ſay, one halfe of his patrimony; for the reſt he had beſtowed vpon the poore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cecilius</hi> took this charge vpon him, to the end <hi>Ciprian</hi> might better attend vnto the ſeruice of God, and pious deeds: for the which he grew ſo renoumed &amp; famous, that shortly after he had bin made prieſt, he was choſen Bishop by all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which dignity he refuſed, as much as might be; alleaging, that in <hi>Carthage</hi> were many prieſts, more auncient, well lettred, and of good life alſo, which deſerued the dignity much more then he, who had bene an Idollater. But the more he refuſed it, the more earneſt the People were in their opinion, and ſaid that <hi>Ciprian</hi> and none
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:181136:37"/>other should be Bishop and prelate of that city.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> ſeeing their reſolution, withdrew himſelf vnto his houſe, and cauſed the gates to be faſt locked. All the People ranne thither in plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and enuironed the houſe in that maner that he repented, that he had shut himſelf therin; and then he wished, he might get downe away from them, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did; but it was impoſſible, for all the waies were forelaid with multitudes of people. There were ſome, who ſeeing how vnwilling <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> was, to accept the dignity, grudged at them which (in a manner) forced him to accept it, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome of his imperfections: and ſaying alſo that it was not fit, that one who was ſo lately an Idollater should be elected a Bishop ſo ſoone. But <hi>S. Ciprian</hi> being <hi>Bishop,</hi> vſed thoſe perſons that depraued him, with gret loue and kindnes, to the wonder of all men that knew it.</p>
               <p>When he had accepted the charge and office of a Bishop, he shewed, that in ſuch, and like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the voice of the people is the voice of God. No humaine toung can expreſſe, with what ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and prudence, he exerciſed himſelf in that office. He was compaſſionate toward the brethren and the humble, but toward the vaine glorious and hauty, he was rigorous, and auſtere. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies looked with a cheerefull countenaunce, but yet with grauity; in ſuch maner, that one could not know, whether he was more to be loued or feared, although he deſerued both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>His apparell was not very coſtly, nor yet altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe and baſe, becauſe the too much or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:181136:37"/>was a thing reprouable for his perſon, &amp; the too litle was not fit nor conuenient in reſpect of his function. He was very merciful toward the poore, and gaue them much almoſe, of the mony which many rich men gaue vnto him very largely. By theſe pious deeds <hi>Ciprian</hi> became in few daies ſo famous, that among the heathen alſo he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed and no leſſe hated; as one, by whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes many left their paganiſme, and were made Chriſtians. For which cauſe they conferred among themſelues howe they might take his life away, and to haue a commaundement for it from Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours <hi>Valerian</hi> and <hi>Gallien,</hi> who at that time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Church moſt cruelly, and put many Chriſtians to death euery day.</p>
               <p>God did not permit that this their purpoſe should come to paſſe as yet. Becauſe a man of ſuch holy life, and excellent learning as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> was for ſome short time neceſſary to be in the church, to the end, he might with this holy ſermons and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, draw many ſoules out of the bandes of ſinne, &amp; bring them vnto pennance; and to the end, he might exhort many to forſake the world, and enter into relligion, and that many damoſells liuing in monaſteries, might keep perpetuall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity.</p>
               <p>This excellent doctor was alſo neceſſary, for no preach the truch vnto the heretiks, the vnion vnto the ſchiſmatiks, and peace vnto the children of God. He was aſſo neceſſary for the incouragement of the martirs, &amp; to perſuade them with a willing mind, to ſuffer torments and death, for the ſake of IESVS CHRIST, with hope to acquire the crowne
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:181136:38"/>of glorie in heauen. He was likewiſe neceſſary, to the end that they which only loſt their goods in the perſecution, should be by him comforted, in making them aſſured, that they should haue them doubled in heauen.</p>
               <p>This perſecution being runne through diuers provinces and cities, came alſo vnto <hi>Carthage;</hi> and was put in execution, with ſuch rage and fury, that it was worthy of note, to ſee the miſerable Chriſtians to goe, one this way, another that way, all of them in feare and dread, labouring one while to ſaue their goods, another while to preſerue their liues. In a short time the priſons were replenished with Chriſtians; &amp; not with thiefs or malefactors. There was no offence punished, but that which ſeemed moſt heinous vnto the painimes, to be a Chriſtian. After certein daies expired, the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which were impriſoned, were taken forth and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the high ſtreets with diuerſity of torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Theire dead bodies lay in heapes, and no man was ſo hardy, as to touch, or bury them.</p>
               <p>What did the holly Bishop S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> in this time of great calamity and miſery? He called the Chriſtians to him, ſome times one, and ſometimes another; and led them into certeine ſecret places, where he preached vnto them; telling them, that the time was euen nowe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, in which it was to be clearly ſeen, who was in deed the frend of God, by perſeuering in the confeſſion of the faith: by not fearing the tirants, that had power to do harme only vnto their bodies, and not vnto their ſoules: but rather, the more the bodies were abuſed, the more glory should redound vnto their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:181136:38"/>ſoules: that therefore, they should not hate the tirants which perſecuted them; but rather loue, and pray vnto God for them; knowing that IESVS CHRIST hath ſaid, that the difference between the Chriſtian and the pagan is, that the Chriſtian doth loue his frends and foes alſo, whereas the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan loueth none, but his frends. He made vnto them demonſtration of this verity, by the example of CHRIST, who praied for them that Crucified him: and that therefore, if they would be his true children, they ought to imitate him in works. Many other things ſaid the good prelate vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which if the tirants had heared, they might haue bene conuerted by theſe words. Yet they brought forth very gret fruite in the harts of the catholikes becauſe they did much animate them, not to fear the rigour to the perſecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ciprian</hi> alſo ordeined many things, to preuent and auoid many incoueniences, which happened euery day. As to apoint ſtout and luſty fellowes, who in the night, at certein howers of ſecurity, took away the bodies of the Martirs, which lay in the ſtreets, and buried them: to others he gaue in charge, that the Chriſtians, which came out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with life, (yet very euill entreated with torments) should be led by them vnto their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; there they should ſee them haue phiſik with all ſpeed. He ordeined others to helpe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which were deſigned to be taken, and fled hither and thither; and to prouide them ſuſtena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce and clothing. Theſe, and ſuch others the like prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, did the Bleſſed Bishop make, in that time full of calamity: and he had ſuch a notable gift in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:181136:39"/>commaunding things to be done, that euery one obeied him. And though they put them ſelues in manifeſt daunger, yet did they performe all his commaundements.</p>
               <p>The Proconſull, who had the charge in <hi>Carthage</hi> to perſecute the Chriſtiants, was aduertiezed of the good deeds that <hi>Cyprian</hi> did; wherupon he would be informed, who he was: and when he heard that the people loued him, and that he was of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority with euery one, he durſt not arreſt him, to put him to death; but cauſed his commaundement to be declared vnto him; which was, that he should depart from <hi>Carthage,</hi> and go vnto a city called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubitana</hi> In that place he ſtaied about a yeare, but the Proconſull deceaſing, he retruned vnto a place neere vnto <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ſtaied in certein gardeins, which had bene ſometimes parcell of his owne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and which he had ſold to be ſpent in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſe. But he which had purchaſed them, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; reſtored them agein vnto him freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any recompence. And if the perſecution had ceaſed, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had ſould them ageine, and had giuen the price (coming of them agein) vnto the poore.</p>
               <p>Remaining certein daies in theſe gardeins, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with manie prieſts and deacons, and other friendes (among whom was <hi>Pontius</hi> who wrote his life) many of the city of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and of other places alſo came to viſite S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and to confer with him of heauenly matters; and at all times they found him affable and curteous. Euery one was by him comforted, euery one holpen; and he perſuaded and exhorted them all to ſerue God.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:181136:39"/>
               <p>Some of his frends beſought him to depart from thence, and to remaine a litell further of from the Proconſul who being newly come might ſeek to get him into his handes, and put him to death; therefore ſtaying there, he was in great daunger. But he, (who had receued a reuelation, that about one yeres end after his banishment, he should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the crown of martirdome,) had not the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to depart out of that place; for he had a gret deſire to die for the faith of CHRIST.</p>

To that place reſorted much people, euery one deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſee their prelate aliue, for they were aſſured, that right ſoone they should ſee him dead. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came alſo many deuout women, but he cauſed them to depart to auoid occaſion of offence.</p>
               <p>On the next morning the holy Bishop was brought before the Proconſull <hi>Galerius Maximus,</hi> apparellend in pontificall veſtures, which made a goodly, &amp; maieſtical shewe. when the Proconſull ſawe him he ſaid; Art thou that <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that haſt the title of Pope, or gret Bishop?

               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:181136:40"/>
               <p>The proconfull waxing wroth ſaid: Thou haſt liued ſacrilegiouſly, and haſt drawen many vnto thy deuotions, &amp; you all haue made a confederacie againſt the Gods, whom the Romain Emperous adore, &amp; thou wouldeſt neuer obey their decrees. But becauſe thou art the author of this euill, my will is that thy doctrine be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thy bloud, to the end, thy adherents may take example by thee, and be aduiſed by thy death. Hauing ſaid thus: he pronounced the ſentence, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> should be beheaded. The bleſſed Bishop ſaid then. I render infinite thanks vnto God, who is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deliuer me from the priſon of this body. The officers of Iuſtice incon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>When they came to the place of martirdome, the B. Bishop put of his pontificall attire, and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and foulded vp the ſame agein, and gaue it vnto his deacons, and remained only in his laſt linnen garment. He then requeſted one of his frends, to giue him ſome mony, who gaue him. 20. pieces of gold, all which he gaue vnto the headſman, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the ſeruice he expected to receaue of him. His frinds and the cleargy, that were in the place lamented bitterly, and laid their garments on the ground, that his bleſſed bloud might fall on the ſame. He himſelf put the napkin ouer his eies, and being on his knees, the headſman performed his office.</p>
               <p>Aſſone as S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> was beheaded, the prieſts
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:181136:40"/>that were in that place very reuerently took vp his body, and caried it vnto the graue. But they fearing leſt the pagans would take it out of that publike place, and vnbury it, and pull and diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it in pieces, the ſame prieſts by night took it out of that place, and caried it vnto the field of <hi>Macrobius Candidus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was the firſt prelat that was martiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>Africa.</hi> Of him, his life and death, much mention is made by many holy men and graue Authors.

               </p>
               <p>You muſt note, that <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſaith: that <hi>S.

And this he ſaith, was the occaſion of his conuerſion, and that the yong maid <hi>Iuſtina</hi> was martired with him. <hi>Marcus Marulus</hi> ſaith the ſame.</p>
               <p>They &amp; the others that ſay thus, ar deceued; for they make but one <hi>Ciprian</hi> of two, that were. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> B. of <hi>Carthage,</hi> a moſt holy doctor and martir, was one; and <hi>Ciprian</hi> the ſorcerer or coniurer, was another: The times, wherin thes two <hi>Ciprians</hi> liued, were diuers; and the Church celebrateth their feaſts on ſeuerall daies. The feaſt of S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</hi> B. of <hi>Carthage</hi> whoſe life we haue written at this time, is celebrated on the ſame day that the feaſt of S. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the pope is, vnto whom he

               <p>IN the time of the Emperour <hi>Dyocletian,</hi> there was in the citty of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> a Senator called <hi>Philophronius,</hi> he had only one daughter named <hi>Euphemia,</hi> that being a Chriſtian, was as much ennobled for her vertue, as for her bloud. Shee was put into priſon by a Proconſull called <hi>Priſcus,</hi> who commanded her to ſacrifiſe vnto his gods.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:181136:42"/>The holy virgin denied it with a valiant courage, for which cauſe, he put her into a more lothſome priſon, and after a fewe daies, brought her to a publike hearing; and then ſeeing her to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and reſolute, he commaunded her to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. The torments were ſuch, that they would haue bereaued the ſtouteſt and luſtieſt man of his life, and much more ſuch a tender damoſell, as <hi>Euphemia</hi> was.</p>
               <p>At the firſt, they did beat her with wands of I<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ron: then they put her on the torture called <hi>Eculeus</hi> which diſiointed all her tender limmes. Then an engin was made with a wheele full of kniues; which being turned round about, came to ſtrike alwais in that ſame place where the holy ſaint was to be tied. The wheele was in order, and <hi>Euphemia</hi> was tied, but bicauſe the torment was ſo dreadfull, the holy ſaint made her oraiſons vnto God; and behold there deſcended from heauen an Angell, who broke it to shiuers. The maker of that engine died in that place with many other perſons; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the kinsfolke and frends of the ſlaine men, kindled a great fire to haue burned the holy virgin therin, as though shee had bene the cauſe of their deaths: but by the grace &amp; fauour of God, she was freed from thoſe fiery flames, with out receauing any harme at all.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the proconſull commaunded shee should be giuen as a pray vnto the cruelty of ſauage beaſts She being already wearied of enduring ſo great torments, beſought God, that this might be the laſt, and ſo it was: for there were let out vpon her two fierce Lyons, which killed her: but they did not eate
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:181136:42"/>her flesh at all, and in this maner was finished the glorious conflict of S. <hi>Euphemia.</hi>

               <p>At that time, the perſecution which <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> vſed againſt the Chriſtians, was terrible, and executed with all rigoure: the accurſed ſonne went to one of them, &amp; accuſed his mother <hi>Lucy,</hi> to be a Chriſtian.

               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Ianuarius</hi> and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, that is to ſay, <hi>Feſtus Soſius</hi> and <hi>Proculus</hi> Deacons, <hi>Deſiderius</hi> the lector, <hi>Acatius,</hi> and <hi>Eutiches</hi> were martired nere vnto the city of <hi>Pozzuole,</hi> vnder the perſecution of Themperour <hi>Diocleſian, Tymotheus</hi> gouerning that prouince for him. This gouernor being ſent by Themperour vnto <hi>Nola</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> with commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion to root out the Chriſtians; apprehended and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:181136:44"/>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned <hi>Soſius</hi> Deacon of the church of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and <hi>Proculus</hi> deacon of the church of <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi> and <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and <hi>Eutiches,</hi> cittizens of <hi>Nola</hi> and laymen.</p>
               <p>But he commaunded <hi>Ianuarius</hi> the B. of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentum,</hi> (accuſed a fore that time to be a Chriſtian) to be layd hold on, and brought before him. And when he nether for much entreaty, nor for sharp threats, would be drawen to the ſacrifice of the Idolls, the gouernour apointed a fornace to be heated three daies together with continuall fire, and that then <hi>Ianuarius,</hi> who in the meane ſpace was kept in priſon vnder a ſure gard, should be caſt therinto in the midſt of the burning flames with out any releaſe or fauour to be shewed. He entred the ſame, hauing with gret humility made his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto God, where ſinging together with the Angels, he went vp and downe without any hurt at all vnto his body.</p>
               <p>The ſouldiers made relation of this miracle vnto the gouernour, who bad them open the mouth of the ouen wider, that it might be ſeen more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly if it was ſo, as they ſaid: which when they did, the flame broke, and rushed out violently, and conſumed a huge number of the pagans that ſtood about it. But <hi>Ianuarius</hi> came forth of the ouen ſo, that there was no shewe or apperaunce that any thing was burned; no not, ſo much as the heare of his head, or his garment he had on. The gouernour attributed (impiouſly) this thing vnto ſorcery, and comitted him againe into faſt priſon. but on the next day, he called him to appeare before him, and in a raging fury, made the officers to ſcourge him, which they did vntill the ſinewes were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:181136:45"/>from his body, and then he returned him back to the priſon, in which time he deuiſed and inuented new punishments, and torments, for his further affliction.</p>
               <p>Vpon this; <hi>Feſtus</hi> the Deacon, and <hi>Deſiderius</hi> the Lector of the city of <hi>Beneuentum,</hi> went vnto the gouernour, and complained vnto him of the great torturs the holy prelat had endured: but the tirant not diſgeſting their words and reprofes, they were (by his commaundement) ſtaied, and laid in Irons, in the ſame place where <hi>Ianuarius</hi> was. This being done, <hi>Timotheus</hi> the gouernour determining to go vnto the city of <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi> commaunded all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue named martirs, to be driuen before his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot in fetters, to the terrour and example of other, and that they should be put into the <hi>Amphitheater</hi> of that citie, where the Beares should be put out againſt them. But the ſauage beaſts forgetting their naturall fiercenes, laid aſide all their cruelty, and became mild, &amp; tractable like lambs, lying downe at the feet of the martirs. The Gouernour not knowing what to do more vnto them, at the ſight herof gaue ſentence that they should be beheaded.</p>
               <p>The which ſentence being read forthwith, and the holy Saints being led to the execution therof, the gouernour miraculouſly became blind of both his eyes. Wherfore he inſtantly ſent back for <hi>Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and beſought him to make his praiers vnto his God for him, that he might be deliuered from this miſerable darknes: which <hi>Ianuarius</hi> doing, his fight was reſtored incontinently. The pagans ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this euident miracle, 5000. of them were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto the faith of CHRIST. but the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:181136:45"/>was no leſſe vnthankfull for the benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, then obſtinate in his euill purpoſe; but was more enraged, for the conuerſion of ſo many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſent back <hi>Ianuarius</hi> and the others alſo, to be put to death according to the ſentence.</p>
               <p>A certein old man requeſted <hi>Ianuarius</hi> to leaue ſome thing of his vnto them, that should be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or remembrance of his martirdome, and of his death, &amp; avowed that he would keep it as a Iewell; vnto whom the Bishop promiſed to giue his nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin after his death. To conclude, the holy martirs were beheaded: to wit, <hi>Ianuarius</hi> Bishop, <hi>Feſtus</hi> and <hi>Proculus</hi> Deacons, <hi>Deſiderius</hi> lector, <hi>Acatius</hi> and <hi>Eutiches;</hi> afterward <hi>Soſius,</hi> who among the reſt shewed himſelfe moſt couragious and prompt to dy, though kept in priſon ſome fewe daies before he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Ianuarius</hi> did appeare vnto that ſame old man after his martirdome, and according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he made vnto him in his life, he gaue vnto him his napkin or ſcarfe, (wetted in his bloud) wherwith he had couered his face, when he was beheaded. The ſame ſcar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e or napkin the good old man shewed vnto the officers, that came back from the execution. And at the ſame houre the holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs were put to death, the gouernour was haled by the deuill, and by him long vexed, and in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery died. The mother of S. <hi>Ianuarius</hi> being then in <hi>Beneuento,</hi> (where her dwelling was) ſawe in her ſleep her ſonne in the sky vp toward heauen: and shee noting the hour, &amp; the day of the viſion, (ſo I call it rather then a dreame) found that at the ſame time he had receiued the crowne of martirdome.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:181136:46"/>
               <p>There alſo befell in this his martirdome another conſiderable accident, which was: when the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir of God <hi>Ianuarius</hi> was beheaded, and that the napkin or ſcarfe was bound ouer his eys, there fell vnto the earth together with his head one of the fingers of his hands alſo. And whileſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans attended, and waited oportunity to burie his bodie by night, as alſo the bodies of the other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs; <hi>Ianuarius</hi> appeared vnto them, &amp; willed them to ſearch for his finger, &amp; to bury it with his head, that was cut of: which they diligently and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely did, and buried all theſe bleſſed bodies nere vnto the citie with great honour, religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.</p>
               <p>Then did euery one of the cities there about of a good pious deſire, elect and chooſe ſome one of theſe glorious martirs to their protectors and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons. The <hi>Neapolitans</hi> caried away the body of S. <hi>Ianuarius,</hi> which had bin firſt at <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Beneuento,</hi> and then came to the goodly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie of <hi>Monte Virgine,</hi> and laſtly, in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> 6. Pope it was tranſlated vnto <hi>Naples,</hi> and entombed very honorably in the Cathedrall Church: In which place may be continuallie ſcene very great miracles. And this alſo shalbe worthy of eternall memorie, that when there came from the hill <hi>Veſuuius,</hi> (nowe called <hi>Mount de Somma</hi>) balles of fire and ashes in ſuch aboundance, that not only the inhabitants dwelling nere thereunto, but alſo they which dwelt further of, were in great dread and feare that all the country there about would be conſumed and deſtroyed by the fire; the ſame was wholly and vtterlie extinct &amp; quenched,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:181136:46"/>by the merits and patronage of this bleſſed Saint. Wherfore the Grecians haue put him in their Kal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender, and do likewiſe euerie yeare make an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable memorie of him, in celebrating the feaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall day of his martirdome.</p>
               <p>Yet moſt ſtupendious is the miracle, &amp; ſtraunge the wonder, that to this day is ſeen in the ſame city of <hi>Naples,</hi> which is this. His bloud, which is kept is in a violl of glaſſe, congealed and hardened very much, yet let it be put right, before, and againſt the head of <hi>S.

The voice replied, I am IESVS CHRIST the ſonne of God, who diſcended from heaven vnto earth, and was crucified for the ſaluation of mankind, and roſe ageine to life on the third day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Placidus</hi> replied againe: Lord, what is thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I shall do? In what ſort, wilt thou haue me to ſerue thee? It was anſwered vnto him. My will is that thou, thy wife, and all thy family be Baptiſed, and ſo thou shalt find the true way to go vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and when thou art Baptiſed, my will is: that thou be patien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and tollerat willingly the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that shall be fall vnto thee, and this do for my ſake. This being ſaid: the hart ran ſwiftly away, and departed out of his ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Placidus</hi> wondered excedingly: and at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant God touched his hart, and ſo enlightened him, that he beheld the blindnes and miſery, in which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:181136:48"/>he then was, by giuyng diuine worship to ſtocks and ſtones. He went home without delay, and conferred, and shewed his intent vnto ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and to conclude, he was Baptiſed, wherin he chaunged his name from <hi>Placidus,</hi> and took the name of <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> his wife called <hi>Theopiſta</hi> and his two so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes <hi>Agapitus &amp; Theopiſtus</hi> were Baptiſed alſo.</p>
               <p>After a few dayes, <hi>Euſtachius</hi> being well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Chriſtian faith, the deuill began (God permitting it) to perſecute him,<note place="margin">Iob. c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> as he did <hi>Iob.</hi> The firſt thing was; he ſlewe all his beaſts and cattail, wherof he had great ſtore; then did all his ſlaues and bondmen dye: and briefely he loſt all his goods, became ſo poore, and was ſo abandoned of the world, that he was forced to depart out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and lead a priuate life in a poore village. In that place the fiend did alſo perſecute him, for he inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome wicked perſons to take his wife from him, and he had not power to reſiſt and withſtand them, but God did always ſo preſerue her that shee was neuer dishonored. He loſt alſo his two ſonnes, and he remained alone, in ſo great neceſſity, that he was faine to dwell with a rich citizen, who made him his baily, and ouerſeer ouer one of his farmes in the countrey.</p>
               <p>Although the good <hi>Euſtachius</hi> ſawe himſelf brought into this great miſery; yet euidently appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ared in him a generous mind, and Chriſtian reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to tollerat euery thing with patience. God proued him like another <hi>Iob,</hi> but when he was in this hard caſe, he thought of him, and reſtored him vnto his former eſtate. For the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> hauing deſigned to make a warre of much import,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:181136:48"/>and conſidering that to bring it to the wished end, he muſt haue an expert generall, he called <hi>Placidus</hi> to his remembrance, whom he iudged a man fit for that charge: After diligent enquiry, he was found, and madegenerall of the forces. which charge he hauing receaued, as he was carefull in muſtering men for this gret ſeruice, he came to the knowledg of his two ſonnes <hi>Agapiſtus,</hi> and <hi>Theopiſtus,</hi> who were among the other ſouldiors of the army. He alſo found again his wife, who in poore and mean array was a ſeruant to an Inholder. The ioy <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> had, and the infinite thanks he yelded vnto God, to ſee him ſelf deliuered and freed from his former miſeries, and to haue found again his wife and two ſonnes, cannot with words be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>After he had accomplished his entrepriſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him, he retorned vnto <hi>Rome</hi> with great honor, and found <hi>Traian</hi> dead, and <hi>Adrian</hi> inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the empire. <hi>Euſtachius</hi> was receued into <hi>Rome</hi> with gret pompe and triumph, aſwell by the Emperour as by the wholl ſenate. And becauſe the cuſtome of the Romain Capteins was; that when they entred <hi>Rome</hi> with Victory, they went vnto the temple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> &amp; there they ſacrificed, <hi>Euſtachius</hi> excuſed himſelf, ſaieng, he could not do it, bicauſe he was a Chriſtian. Themperour, the Senate, and all the people thought, that if the accuſtomed ſacrifice was not done, they should neuer after haue any victory, for which cauſe, thy were very earneſt that <hi>Euſtachius</hi> should ſacrifice. <hi>Euſtachius</hi> confidently denied to do it, ſaieng, he was a Chriſtian; and that he would not ſacrifiſe vnto any, but vnto IESVS CHRIST.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:181136:49"/>
               <p>Themperour being wroth at this anſwer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> his wife, and two ſonnes should be put to death: and to effect it, he bad, that they should be put in a place, where a fierce Lyon should tear them in pieces. The Lyon was let out againſt the holy martirs, but he lay downe at their feet, and did them no hurt at all. Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſeeing the ſame, commaunded to make a gret bull of braſſe hollowe inward. With in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauity he cauſed S. <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> his wife, and ſonnes, to be incloſed, and then to ſett fire vnder it, and in this torment the glorious ſaints rendered their ſoules vnto God. The Bull was opened, and their bodies were found with out any blemish (but that they were dead) and had not burnt one heare of their head, which aſtonished the Pagans, and much edified rhe Catholiks; who tooke thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bodies, and buried them honourably.</p>
               <p>The martirdome of theſe holy ſaints was on the ſame day the Catholik Church celebrateth their feaſt, to wit: on the. 20. day of <hi>September,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord. 118.</p>

                  <hi>Theſe men might ſay to</hi> S.

               <p>SAINT <hi>Matthew</hi> was a <hi>Galylean,</hi>

                  </note> for the Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> to enforce them (being the elect people of God) to pay tribute and tolles. And all though they paied, yet they alwais proteſted, that vyolence and force was offered to them. their aggreeuances were encreaſed, by the letting out the tributes and tolles to farme, which is the cauſe, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicans, (who were they that rented them, and moreouer lent money vpon vſury) were counted by the Iewes worſe then the Pagans and heretiks. for which cauſe the ſonne of God (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:181136:51"/>to their opinion) when he inſtructed S. <hi>Peter</hi> how to correct his brother,<note place="margin">Math. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> ſaid vnto him, that the ſinner should be reproued firſt ſecretly; the ſecond time before two witneſſes; and that at the third time, he should deuounce it to the Church: and if he did not then amend, he should be reputed as an Ethnick or Publican. As if he would inferre; Repute him then as an Ethnick, account him as a Publican, tolle gatherer, or vſurer. Which among the Iewes was a name of ſurpaſſing reproach and infamy.</p>
               <p>One of theſe was S. <hi>Matthew (Syea Metaphraſtes</hi> ſaith) he was the head of them all, for he was a man expert, practicall, and of a good in ſight. It fell out then,<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>Matthew</hi> being at the receit of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, IESVS CHRIST paſſing that way looked on him, called him and ſaid, <hi>Followe me:</hi> Aſſone as <hi>Matthew</hi> hard theſe words, preſently he left his books, his writings, money, and other things, and followed him.</p>
               <p>Herein there are two conſiderable things: One is, that IESVS called <hi>Matthew;</hi> and the other is, that <hi>Matthew</hi> followed him. In CHRIST calling of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> may be conſidered his exceding gret mercy: for he called him being a pullik ſinner, to be his diſciple: Nowe who though neuer ſo great a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, will feare to approch come neere vnto CHRIST ſeing how he did wellcome <hi>Matthew?</hi> If IESVS call <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican, what ſinner will he driue away from him? but perhaps the ſinner will ſay, I am content IESVS CHRIST shall not driue me away from him: yet if I should not come vnto him I wishe, that he would behold me, as it pleaſed him
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:181136:51"/>to behold S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and to call me as he called him. To this I anſwer, that it is true, God calleth not euery one with ſuch efficacy, and doth not behold all ſinners, as he beheld S. <hi>Matthew;</hi> for that was a ſpeciall grace done to him, &amp; to fewe others; yet is it moſt true and certain, that God doth behold, and call euery one; and if they will amend, and diſpoſe thmſelues to a better life, he conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to him, and maketh them holy ſaints. we ſee ſome times, that a lodging hath the windowes shut, and the ſunne beateth at them, and cannot enter; if the ſunne do not enter in to the lodging, it is not his fault, but of the man, that doth not open the windowe. Open thou the window, and the ſunne entreth in.</p>
               <p>The ſame doth the ſunne of Iuſtice,<note place="margin">Apoc. <hi>3.</hi> v. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> our Lord God. he ſaith, he ſtandeth at the dore, and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; let the dore be opened to him, let the ſinner be diſpoſed, and do his duety as he ought, and God will not faile for his part. He ſaith not only, that he ſtandeth at the dore, but ſaith alſo, that he knocketh and calleth. And in deed he ſaith the truth, for he doth neuer any other thing, but call; and that all men might heare him ſpeak, he mounted vpon the tree of the Croſſe. To that place euery ſinner may look; and ſee that IESVS is euen hoarſe with calling ſo much. He shall ſee his two eyes are become two founteins, and for that he ſeeth fewe people come to his ſide, he doth not shew himſelf ſterne or fierce againſt them that haue offended him; but rather kinde and louing. He ſtandeth with his armes abroad, to embrace them that reſort to him. He boweth his head to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:181136:52"/>giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kiſſe of peace, he sheweth his pierced ſide, that they may enter into his hart. He calleth not the Chriſtian to take of the croune of thornes, and to put it on his owne head. He would not be ſpoiled of his beatings, and load him. He would not haue him drink the gall and vinagre, which was giuen him. He would not haue him nailed to the Croſſe in his company. To conclude, he doth not call him, to take life away from him; but to giue life vnto him. He calleth him to come into his company, and to continew in ioy and gladnes.</p>
               <p>Yet true it is, that he would haue the ſinner do penance,<note place="margin">Math. <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> and not lay it wholly on CHRIST back. But let the pennance be neuer ſo great, if that, which CHRIST hat ſuffered for the ſinnes of other men be conſidered, who will think the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance done for our owne proper ſinnes, to be ouer great. In this maner CHRIST IESVS calleth euery one, and repelleth none from him; yet fewe there be who are ſo called, that go after him. To ſuch as theſe be happeneth the ſame that before to <hi>Samuell</hi> being yet a child, for God called him, &amp; he went to <hi>Heli</hi> being an old man, and neere to his death.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Reg. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> CHRIST calleth many alſo, and they chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishly runne vnto the world, and to vanity.</p>
               <p>Such as theſe be, do not imitate S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who was called but once by our Sauiour; &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent he followed him. S. <hi>Matthew</hi> did not ſay, I will firſt diſpatch my buſines, and ſumme vp my acconts, nor ſought for excuſes as many ſinners do (prolonging their conuerſion vnto God,) but he left euery thing at an inſtant. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith; he that firſt took away other mens goods, nowe left
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:181136:52"/>and forſook his owne. When a wand is crooked, if one would ſtreighten it, he muſt draw it the other way: So <hi>Zacheus,</hi> who was another publican,<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> ſaid, if he had deceiued any man he would reſtore it foure fold. But the good S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> not only ſatisfied the deceit done, with part of his goods; but left all, and followed IESVS CHRIST. You ought alſo to vnderſtand, that the ſame S. <hi>Mathew</hi> reciting his conuerſion ſaith, that he made a feaſt forthwith vnto our Sauior; which he did, not ſo much to honour him, as that he might conuert many of his kinsfoolk and frends, that came to the banquet. This is true charity, when one is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſerue God himſelf only; but procureth and enduceth others to ſerue him alſo.</p>
               <p>The Scribes and Phariſies who were a people malignant, and enuious againſt CHRIST, and ſought to find faults in his doings and ſpeeches, being certefied of this banquet, thought they had gotten a iuſt occaſion to reproue him, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they came vnto his diſciples, and ſaid; <hi>why doth your maister eate with Publicans and ſinners?</hi> as if they would ſay: Come hither you ignorant and baſe fellowes; Is it poſſible, that you dare keep company with a man, that is a frend to Publicans and ſinners,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> and that eateth and drinketh with them?

               <p>When IESVS vnderſtood this (nothing being vnknowen vnto him) he congregated all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles together, (and perhaps they who vſed thoſe words of defamation, were preſent there alſo) and ſaid vnto them: I am defamed and euill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, for that I conuerſe with Publicans and ſinners, and becauſe I eate and drink with them; but I will tell you the truth, which none of you can deny,<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>5.</hi> Marc. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> to wit; that <hi>they who are whole, haue no need of the phiſition, but the ſick only.</hi> This ſentence of our Sauiour may haue two ſences. One ſence is; that he ſpake by the figure <hi>Ironia,</hi> and ſaid: See that I come not into your company, for you be all holy men, and need not me, but I conuerſe with Publicans and ſinners, who haue need of me. The other ſence is; that IESVS CHRIST, ſpake plainely and cleerly, that, as the hole man hath no need of the phiſition, but the ſick man hath; ſo IESVS did conuerſe with Publicans, which were ſick in their ſoules, to reſtore them vnto their health; for we may piouſly beleeue, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted many of them, that were at the feaſt that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> made in his houſe.</p>
               <p>There is no more particular mention in the ghoſpell of S. <hi>Matthew;</hi> but we are to beleeue, that he was preſent in all thoſe things, where the twelue Apoſtles are ſaid to be preſent. as when our ſauior ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to preach vnto the Samaritans, S. <hi>Mathew</hi> went thither alſo: when there was ſtrife among the Apoſtles. who should be greateſt, he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:181136:53"/>was there alſo; and it may be he alleaged his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſaid: that he ought to haue the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, for that he had left more poſſeſſions and goods, them any other of them. He was preſent at the reſuſcitation of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> he was with CHRIST when he made his entry into <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> on Palme ſonday. He was one of them, that eate the paſchall lambe: our Lord washed his feet, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and made him prieſt, and conſecrated him Bishop, as he did his other Apoſtles. He was with the other Apoſtles, when our Lord appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after his Reſurrection; when he aſcended into heauen, and at the coming of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>He preached eight years among the Hebrews, after the which he wrote his Goſpell in the hebrew toungue, as he had preached; being then to depart and to preach among the heathenish paynims. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith <hi>S.

The <hi>Bishop Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poman</hi> ſaith it is not knowen certainly, what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to S. <hi>Mathew</hi> in thoſe parts. <hi>Simeon metaphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes</hi> alſo in two treatiſes he made of this holy ſaint paſſeth this matter ouer ſuccinctly and ſleightly. This Author ſaith; that the Apoſtles went alone, poore, afflicted, paſſing from one countrey to another, publishing the name and faith of IESVS CHRIST before the kings and princes of the world, and that therfore fewe could ſet downe their acts in particuler. But for what which is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne, (although it be very litle) we ought to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thanks to God who would not permit all their

Nicephorus maketh a different report of the martirdome of this Apoſtle, from that which is ordinarilie ſaid of it, and from that which S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Florence</hi> writeth in his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioachim Perionius,</hi> and the author called <hi>Abdias Babilonicus</hi> ſaith thus as a thing certain, (and the Romaine Breuiarie of <hi>Pius 5.</hi> receiueth it alſo) that <hi>S. Matthew</hi> hauing preached among the Hebrewes, and in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and hauing written his ghoſpell in the Hebrewe toung, (a coppy wherof S. <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Apoſtle caried with him, when he preached vnto the Gentills, and layeng it ſometime on a ſick perſon, it reſtored him to perfect health) paſſed on to preach in <hi>Ethiope:</hi> And that coming into the city called <hi>Nadauer,</hi> he found there two magitians, the one called <hi>Zaroes,</hi> &amp; the other <hi>Arphaxat.</hi> Theſe two wicked fellowes kept all the people in awe: for with their inchantments, and <hi>Legier-de-main,</hi> they did great hurt vnto many, depriuing ſome of the vſe of their limmes, &amp; weakening other. They bewitched the armes of ſome, &amp; made other lame of their legges, and others blind. The apoſtle ſeing the euill and wickednes they did, (and that there was no remedy, for none could barre them of their willes, but to their loſſe &amp; damage,) oppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt them, and healed all them, whom they had made ſick.</p>
               <p>There was in that city,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> an Eunuck (who had bene Baptished by <hi>S. Philip</hi> the deacon, when he departed from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>) and was ſeruant to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daces</hi> Queene of <hi>Ethiope,</hi> as being her Steward, and hauing all her riches vnder his gouernemenr: he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:181136:54"/>lodged <hi>S. Matthew</hi> in his houſe, and by his meanes many receued the faith of CHRIST: for he brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght many of the people, to heare <hi>S. Matthew</hi> preach, who were conuerted to Chriſtianity, by hearing his admirable doctrine.</p>
               <p>The two magitians perceuing S. <hi>Mathew</hi> to be ſo contrary vnto their proceedings; by their diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish art, made two dragons to appeare, not only to affright S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> but alſo to do him ſome ſcath. The holy Apoſtle made the ſigne of the Croſſe againſt the two dragons; who, as if they had bene two sheepe, returned quietly vnto the deſert. The people beheld this ſtrange wonder, wherfore euery one beſought the Apoſtle earneſtly to ſet them free from thoſe two ſorcerers: for their pride and malignity was come to that height, that they would be adored for godds by the people; and they for dread and feare, were in mind to do the ſame. The Apoſtle made aunſwer: To ſo many, as would be Baptiſed, and acknowledg IESVS CHRIST for the true God, it would be very eaſie to be ridd and freed from thoſe two villaines, or any other ſuch, who ſoeuer would do them any harme.</p>
               <p>Them he preached vnto them the miſtry of the Incarnation of the ſonne of God, and of the glory and beatitude of the holy ſaints; and it befell, whileſt he preached a great vproare and tumult aroſe among the people for the death of the kinges ſonne. Then it came to their eares, that he had bene ſick ſome time before, and the two magitians had bene called to help him, and he died between their hands. and the wicked villaines, to hide and couer their falshood, ſaid: that the godds deſired to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:181136:55"/>haue his company. and that therefore it was meet, there were a Temple builded vnto him, wherein he might be adored as a God. The Eunuke brought S. <hi>Matthew</hi> before the king, and he by his praiers raiſed the deceaſed yong man vnto life againe, to the great aſtonishment of them all. The king was called <hi>Egippus,</hi> and had ſuſteined vnſpeakable ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the death of his ſonne; but ſeing him aliue againe and in health he was glad, and reioiced out of meaſure. He shewed many curteſies vnto the Apoſtle, and ſent poſtes into all parts of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to diuulge this miracle, and to ſay: Come and ſee a God in the shape of a man, who hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a dead man, and reſtored him to life.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Iſidore</hi> in his Breviary maketh mention of this miracle of raiſing the kings ſonne from death to life by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and alſo of the two dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and of other miracles, and admirable acts the Apoſtle did in Ethiope, although he do not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaith alſo, that much people came vnto the place, where S. <hi>Matthew</hi> lodged, and would haue done ſacrifice to him, as if he had bene a God, and preſented many gifts vnto him: and that the Apoſtle ſaid vnto them: I am not a God, but a mortall man, and the ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST, who is the true God. Then he requeſted them, to beſtow thoſe preſents and gifts (which they would haue giuen him) vpon the building of a temple to the ſame IESVS CHRIST, for he (whom he preached, and by whoſe power, he did thoſe miracles) was the true liuing God; exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to be Baptiſed in his name, for that was the true waye and meanes to obteine euerlaſting
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:181136:55"/>life. To conclude: the Apoſtle ſaid ſuch words, and confirmed them ſo with miracles, that the king with all his court, and a great number of other people were Baptiſed.</p>
               <p>The king had a daughter called <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> who was very beautifull, but much more commended for her wiſedome, who hauing heard <hi>S. Matthew</hi> oftentimes in his ſermons to commend and extoll virginity, conceiued a good liking of him, and vſing his aduiſe was cloſed in a monaſtery, with 200. other damoſells, deſiring to do the ſame. <hi>S. Matthew</hi> ſtaid in Etiope. 23. years, continually conuerting ſoules to our Lord IESVS, building Churches, ordering prieſts, conſecrating Bishops, gaining many ſoules, and augmenting the faith of CHRIST, and that, which he preached with the mouth, he performed alſo in deeds, to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others,<note place="margin">lib. <hi>2.</hi> peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</note> his life being holy and exemplary. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſaith; that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> neuer eate flesh, and that he liued only with herbes.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Egippus</hi> afterward deceaſing, his brother <hi>Hyrtacus</hi> ſucceeded in the kingdome. This newe king to eſtablish himſelf more ſuerly in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and alſo moued with the rare beauty of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> intended to marry her. To bring this his purpoſe to effect, he acquainted the Apoſtle with his intent, thinking it a good meanes to drawe the mind of the yong woman to his will. The Apoſtle aunſwered the king, that he would giue notice vnto <hi>Iphigenia</hi> of the good, that ariſeth of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and howe it is a holy thing, and that then he might come and talk with her himſelf. The king thought this would be a very good courſe;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:181136:56"/>and for that the Apoſtle ſaid he would declare this matter in a ſermon, the king ſaid, that he would alſo be preſent therat. Sonday came, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the preſence of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> and the other relli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious women (the king being there alſo, and all the cheifeſt Lords of his court,) began to diſcourſe of matrimony, and to shewe, howe neceſſary it was for the conſeruation of mankind, and gaue it other commendations, He alſo ſaid, that matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was ordeined and inſtituted by God, and howe good it was to haue children.</p>
               <p>All this pleaſed <hi>Hirtacus</hi> very well, and he away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to hear the Apoſtle ſay, that <hi>Iphigenia</hi> might forſake and leaue the eſtate of a relligious woman, and take a husband, and be made Queene of <hi>Ethiope.</hi> But the concluſion of Apoſtle was farre otherwiſe, then <hi>Hirtacus</hi> exſpected; for then he fell in hand to treate of the grieyous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that adulteres deſerued: out of which he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to inferre; that if the ſeruant of any king was ſo bold as to take away his wife from him, he did not merite only, to be put out of fauour, and to be diſgraced; but alſo he deſerued to dy an euill death; though he did not effect, but only attempte it. Therefore (ô king) I giue thee to vnderſtand, (ſaid Apoſtle looking vpon him) that <hi>Iphigenia</hi> is the ſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, the king of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; and if thou ſeek to take her away from him, thou shalt fall into his heauy diſpleaſure. When <hi>Hirtacus</hi> perceaued the concluſion of the Apoſtles words, and wherunto they tended; he was moued to great indignation, which he vttered in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and ſo threatning him, he departed out
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:181136:56"/>of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphigenia</hi> was heereat ſurpriſed with great feare; and with the other relligious women kneeled at the feet of the Apoſtle; and asked his aduiſe, what shee and they should do, to be quit of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aſſault the king had begon againſt her virginity. The Apoſtle incouraged them all with good words, and put a veile vpon euery one of their heads, making them hereby, and by their vowing the three vowes of Pouertie, Chaſtity, and Obedience true Nonnes: and theſe were the firſt Nonnes, the were among the Chriſtians. This being done, the Apoſtle ſaid Maſſe; and hauing ended the ſame, there came thither a cruell fellow (ſent by <hi>Hirtacus</hi>) who gaue the Apoſtle many wounds with a ſpeare, ſo that the Altar was all ſtained with bloud, and his body lay dead in the place. The grief and compaſſion of the people for the death of S. <hi>Mathew</hi> was ſo great, that they made a commotion, and roſe in armes, entending to kill the tyraunt; and had effected it, if ſome prieſts had not intromitted themſelues, and ſaid them, ſayeng: that God would not be pleaſed there with, and that therefore he commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to put vp his ſword into the sheath.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Hyrtacus</hi> laboured by the meanes of ſome ladies, to perſuade <hi>Iphigania</hi> to be his wife; but ſeeing that this way would not remoue the holy virgin from her good purpoſe; in a diabolicall rage he cauſed the monaſtery to be fired; but <hi>S. Mathew</hi> was ſeene in the aire to quench it. The ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tyraunt eſcaped not this deſerued punishment, for God ſtrook him with the leproſy, which was ſo
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:181136:57"/>ſore, that he killed himſelf for paine. and the kingdome came to the brother of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Egippus,</hi> who was a Chriſtian, &amp; ruled that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince many years to the honour and glory of God, which was ſpred through all <hi>Ethiope,</hi> where the body of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> was kept and holden in great veneration, and reuerence, vntill the time of pope <hi>Gregory.</hi> 7. when it was tranſlated ro the city of <hi>Salerno</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where it is holden in great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to this day by all good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Great reaſon there is to doe ſo, for that this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Apoſtle hath three honorable titles, for euery of which he meriteth to be honored: The firſt is of Apoſtle, the ſecond of Euangeliſt, &amp; the third of martir. His death was on the 21 day of <hi>September,</hi> and on that day, the Church celebrateth his feaſt, and in the year of our Lord. 90. in the raigne of <hi>Domi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The miſtery may be, (for that all three were great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,) to giue hope to all them, that hartily are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto God, that he not only pardoneth them, but alſo sheweth vnto them eſpeciall fauors, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring them firſt vpon earth, and then making them great alſo in heauen.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ghoſpell of <hi>S. Matthew</hi> (I write this to ſatisfy curious witts) it is commonly ſaid, that he wrote it in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and ſome ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This happeneth for that (as <hi>Guido Fabricius</hi>

Then, I ſay, that <hi>S. Matthew</hi> wrote his goſpell not in that Auncient <hi>Hebrew</hi> language, but in the <hi>Modern Hyeroſolimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> in which CHRIST ſpake. The ſame, which <hi>Guido Fabricius</hi> ſaith, is affirmed alſo by <hi>Petrus Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſinus</hi> in his annotations vpon <hi>Doroteus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> in his book of the lifes of the diſciples of CHRIST.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:181136:59"/>at that time was the head of the people of <hi>Sedun,</hi> called <hi>Agaunum,</hi> &amp; at this preſent it is called S. <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice di Sauoya.</hi> In that place <hi>Maximian</hi> had a mind to make a ſolemne ſacrifice vnto his gods; to the end, they might be his aiders in this his entrepriſe, and commaudned all the principall officers of the army to be preſent thereat. <hi>Maurice,</hi> and his <hi>Thebans</hi> hearing the ſame, ſtepped all aſide ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of the way, ſayeng, that they being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans would not be preſent therat, <hi>Maximian,</hi> being certefied therof, was much diſpleaſed, and tooke it as a mutiney, worthy of ſeuere punishment.</p>
               <p>To which purpoſe he ſent to their quarter the marshall and prouoſt, to chaſtice ſome of them for a terror to the reſt, &amp; to reduce the others vnto the army, and to the ſacrifice: The chaſticement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted was this: The officers made them paſſe vnder a ſpear, and told them; and when they came vnto the tenth man, they incontinent cut of his head: This was the ordinary punishmenr of that time, when an hoſt or Regiment co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted a treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe. The Thebans which remained and eſcaped, (in patient and quiet maner,) boldly ſaid: that they would not be preſent at the ſacrifice, do what they could: Themperour ſeing them to be reſolute, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his anger, and bad that they should be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, or decimated againe, for ſo that punishment was called. This ſentence no leſſe cruell then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, being begun to be executed, it is a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to behold, with what inconquerable courage, the holly martirs ſeemed to tollerate the ſlaughter made of them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> were by nature valiant, and bigge<pb n="113" facs="tcp:181136:59"/>of body, but herin they shewed ſingular and rare valour, in that they did not complain of the tirant, and alſo for that they looked cheerefully on the matter: They animated one the other, but aboue all, <hi>Maurice</hi> their Coronell went amongſt them, exhorting ſometimes this man, otherwhiles that man; and told them, that ſince they had heretofore endaungered their lifes for, and in the Emperours ſeruice, that they should not think much to offer it for the ſeruice of God: for that their death and torment should haue an end very shortly, and tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating it for ſuch a cauſe, they should afterward poſſeſſe the ioies of heauen cuerlaſtingly. Theſe &amp; ſuch other words that <hi>Maurice</hi> ſaid, made ſuch an impreſſion in the minds of thoſe ſeruants of CHRIST, that euery one endeuored to be the firſt martir, and to enter into heauen before his fellow ſouldier.</p>
               <p>The legion being tenthed the ſecond time, the other, which were left, were demaunded, if they would obey the Emperour <hi>Maximian;</hi> and they anſwered: Tell Th'emperour from vs, that we do acknowledg our ſelfs to be his ſouldiers, and withall, that we be the ſeruants and worshippers of the true God; we be bound to obey <hi>Maximian</hi> in things apperteining vnto the warre, but much more bound vnto God in matters of religion: from <hi>Maximian</hi> we haue pay for our ſeruice, but of God we receaue our being, and our life. we may not nor will not deny IESVS CHRIT to obey <hi>Ceſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximian</hi> receauing this anſwer, finding the martirs reſolute, and ſeing the double decimation of them was to ſmall auaile, be commaunded the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:181136:60"/>wholl army to ſet on them, and to cut and hew them to pieces, without reſeruation of any: this quailed not their noble courages; but rather their death being occaſioned for ſo good a cauſe, they kneeled on the bare ground, and lifting vp their hands and harts vnto heauen, yealded to the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and ſlaughter; their Coronell <hi>Maurice</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and inceſſantly incouraging and chearing them vp: and in this maner they were all maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred. Many of the bloudy villans were ſo fleshed herewith, that not content with death, they ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them, and put on their apparell and at mour, and ſat downe to eate the prouiſion, the martirs had.</p>
               <p>It happened, a Chriſtian ſouldier called <hi>Victor,</hi> who was not a Theban but of another nation came by; and beholding ſo many dead bodies ly in that plaine, (not knowing howe it came) asked why thoſe that eate thereby, shewed ſuch mirth and gladnes, and did not loth and abhorre to eat and drink among ſo many dead bodies. One related vnto him point, by point what had befalle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they bade him come &amp; eate, and be mery with them, for ioy they had done ſuch pleaſing ſeruice vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. when <hi>Victor</hi> had heard all their ſpeech: he ſaid aloud: Oh wretch that I am: I wishe I had bene partaker in their death. By theſe words of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> they which ſat at the bloudy banket, gathered, that <hi>Victor</hi> was a chriſtian: wherefore leauing their banquet, and taking their weapons, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent cut him in pieces, as they had done the Thebans, and by this meanes <hi>Victor</hi> merited the ſame reward, that the Thebans had deſerued. This
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:181136:60"/>was the martirdome of S. <hi>Maurice,</hi> and of his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban ſouldiers, and the holy church celebrateth it on the. 22. day of <hi>September,</hi> in the year of our Lord 301 in the time of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After certein years paſſed, the ſame holy martirs reuealed vnto a Bishop, called Theodore, where their bodies were, and commaunded him to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate them to a place more conuenient. The good Bishop was not ſlack or negligent in fulfilling it: for the people of that countrey hauing made many pits, and hauing put the bodyes of the holy martirs into them, the good Bishop cauſed them to digge them out of them, and out of theother places, where thoſe bleſſed bodyes were, as he vnderſtood by the diuine reuelation: and ſent them into diuers countreis, where many Churches were builded vnto their honour, and in them God graunted many fauors vnto ſuch, as, being in tribulation and affliction, did recommend themſelfs vnto theſe bleſſed martirs. In the veſtry of the church in <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> is shewen the head of one of theſe holy martirs: and they ſay there, it is the head of S. <hi>Maurice.</hi>

                     <hi>1.</hi> ep:</note> Paul <hi>gaue vnto the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>there is one in eſpeciall, for Christians to vſe, when they go vnto the Church to pray. He ſaith that men muſt ſtand vncoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when they be in the Church. O holy Apoſtle, shall this be vſed both by men and women? shall the women alſo ſtand with their head vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the Church? The Apoſtle anſwereth and ſaith: for the women we haue another lawe which is this: that women muſt be in the Church with their head couered. for as it is an vnſeemely thing for a ſecular woman to be shauen, and without long haire; ſo is it an vnſeemely thing for women to be in the Church with their head vncouered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. Ambroſe <hi>yealdeth a reaſon of this, and foundeth it vpon theſe wordes of the Apostle, to wit: that the man is the image of God, and the woman is the image of the man, of whom she is formed. This glorious Doctor ſaith alſo; that it was the ordinary vſage, that ſlaues had their heades couered, or bound with certaine bandes. And the difference that was betweene the ſlaues and freemen was this: that the ſalues had the head bound or couered; and the freemen had it vncouered: we may perceiue hereby, that God would haue vs, when we be in his preſence, to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:181136:61"/>acknowledg our quality and condition. The man that is ſuperior in houſe, and that hath authority to comaund therein, must haue his head vncouered and bare, as a free man, and a maſter; but the woman, who is his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and who is obliged to obey in the houſe, ought to haue her head couered, by that meanes confeſſing her quality of obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the man do comaund, and the woman do obey, is a matter of ſuch importance, that not only.</hi> S. Paul <hi>doth comaund it (as is aforeſaid) but</hi> S. Peter <hi>alſo, as chief and higheſt Bishop ordeined, and comaunded the ſame. But for that he left it not in writing,</hi> S. Linus, <hi>who was his diſciple and ſucceſſor in the Papacy, comaunded it, and left it written; that it might be obſerued and kept perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. and in deed it is not read, that he left any other order then this; which, yet if it might be obſerued among all faithfull Chriſtians, were very comendable, and praiſe worthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now let us ſee the life of this holy Pope, collected on: of that which</hi> Damaſus <hi>and other graue Authors write of him. yet firſt, I think good to admonish you, that</hi> S. Peter <hi>being neere to his death, thought it conuenient to nominate a worthy, and weldeſeruing ſuceſſor, to be in his place after him; who might take care, and charge of the Catholique Church. To this entent he named</hi> Clement <hi>his diſciple, who for his great humility willed, that</hi> Linus <hi>and</hi> Cletus, <hi>who had bene coadiutors vnto</hi> S. Peter, <hi>should haue that dignity before him. So</hi> Linus <hi>had the Papacy, vnto whom</hi> Cletus <hi>ſucceeded; and after him the ſame</hi> S. Clement <hi>was Pope. Returning vnto our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the life of</hi> S. Linus <hi>was this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Linus</hi> was borne in <hi>Vol-terra,</hi> a citty of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> and was ſonne of <hi>Hercolanus,</hi> of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:181136:62"/>noble family to the <hi>Mauri.</hi> Being fully 20. yeeres old, he was ſent by his father to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſtudy, where he remained in the houſe of <hi>Quintus Fabius,</hi> his fathers friend, vntill S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle came to <hi>Rome,</hi> to preach the Goſpell. Then this S. <hi>Linus</hi> was of his firſt diſciples, who followed him, aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting him alwaies in his preaching, and in the adminiſtration of the hely Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeing in him many good partes, as his holines, learning, and curteous affability, he made him his coadiutor in the dignity, to the which he was alſo elected, after the death of the Apoſtle. So that firſt he was coadiutor, then Pope, and head of the Church. for the which with great care and prudence he prouided all thinges neceſſarie for the good gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement thereof.</p>
               <p>He comaunded in particuler, that women hould not enter into the Church with their haire looſe, and vntied, but bound vp, and couered, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> had comaunded, and <hi>S. Paul</hi> had left writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. He gaue holy orders twiſe in the month of <hi>December,</hi> and at them he conſecrated 15. Bishops, and ordered 18 Prieſts, with ſome Deacons.</p>
               <p>In the primitiue Church, there was great care had in giuing holy orders; and in receiuing any to the office of a prieſt, or the other orders; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they kept a reconing, and conſerued the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the times when holy orders were giuen, and how many were ordered. Thoſe ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did this, for that this office was ſo reuerend, holy, and ſo hard to diſcharge, that many deputed and apointed to take orders refuſed it. yea ſome there were, that cut of ſome member or other, as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:181136:62"/>their finger, eare, noſe or the like, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues incapable to receiue an office ſo great, and waighty, as Prieſthood is. Moreouer, the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at that time were fewe in number, ſo that there was not ſuch need of ſo many Paſtors.</p>
               <p>If the ſame were done at this preſent, it would ſurely be a notable benefit, aſwell for the one part, as for the other, if that prelates were not ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ready in giuing holy orders, nor ſecular Chriſtians ſo bold and haſty in procuring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the ſame, the Prieſts should not be ſo litle eſteemed, nor the ſeculars haue ſuch occaſion to murmure of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Linus</hi> wrote the deeds and doctrine of S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle his maiſter, and eſpecialy his martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. S. <hi>Linus</hi> being a moſt holy man, caſt out diuells, and raiſed the dead to life. He deliuered from the diuell a yong woman, daughter to the Conſul <hi>Saturninus;</hi> who in recompence of that receaued benefitt by the handes of the good Pope, comaunded he should be put to death; and ſo he was made the martir of IESVS CHRIST. It is no ſmal honour to S. <hi>Linus,</hi> that the Catholike Church hath put his name in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the maſſe, among other holy martirs there me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned.</p>
               <p>The feaſt of S. <hi>Linus</hi> is celebrated on the daie of his martirdom, which was one the 23 of <hi>September,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 81. in the time of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour. This holy Martir held the Papacy 11. yeeres, 3. monthes, and 12, daies: &amp; was buried neere vnto the body of S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle. Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, his holy reliques were tranſlated vnto the citty of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> and laid comely in the Church of <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>ON a time, S. <hi>Paule</hi> departing from <hi>Antioch,</hi> went vnto a city called <hi>Iconium</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> There had bene there before that time <hi>Titus</hi> his diſciple, and had giuen notice and ſignes of him vnto <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> who was a very ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:181136:63"/>man and dwelt in that city. He had related allſo vnto him the doctrine which he preached, his life, and behauior; and informed him of the quality of his perſonage: to wit, that he was a man litle of body, and that he had a hooked noſe, and faire in the face like an Angell.</p>
               <p>When the Apoſtle came vnto the city, <hi>Oneſipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> knew him by the ſignes before told him; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore he led him to his houſe, where ſome people of good intention, and deſirous to finde the true way to eternall life and happines, were aſſembled. The Apoſtle preached vnto them to the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of them, that gaue due attention vnto him.</p>
               <p>In the next houſe to the place where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle preached, there dwelt a damoſell very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but much more vertuous called <hi>Tecla.</hi> This damoſell had a mother liuing, who had made a match, and apointed to marry her, to a yongman called <hi>Tamirus.</hi> It hapened on a time, that <hi>Tecla</hi> ſtanding in a windowe of her houſe, heard from thence the preaching &amp; wordes of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> which made very great impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the mind of the yong damoſell. She being not content to haue heard him this one time, endeauored, and made meanes, to heare him ſondry other times; and ſo long, that her mother came to the knowledge thereof, how the wordes of the Apoſtle, had made her daughter to alter her intent, and purpoſe to marry. Yea, the virgin <hi>Tecla</hi> her ſelf, who was a pagan before, ſaid now boldly that she was a Chriſtian; and she that before was reſolued to take an husband, ſaid now, that she deſired rather to looſe her life, then her virginity.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:181136:64"/>
               <p>The mother made report of theſe things vnto the ſpouſe of her daughter, who finding the ſame to be very true (becauſe <hi>Tecla</hi> her ſelf told him her mind freely, and what she entended to do, which was, that she would not marry but remaine a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) went vnto the Proconſull of the citty, and gaue him notice, that there was a forreiner come into the towne, who took wiues from their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and brought in new and ſtrange Gods, to the notable preiudice, and damage of them all, as being contrary to that their fore fathers had belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. This information was the cauſe, that the Apoſtle was apprehended, cruelly ſcourged, and put in danger of his life, had he not made it knowne vnto them, that he had the priuiledge of a citiſen of <hi>Rome,</hi> by being borne in <hi>Tarſus,</hi> a citty of <hi>Cicilia:</hi> yet for all this, he was driuen, and banished out of the citty. After this, S. <hi>Telcla</hi> was taken, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene examined, and her intention found, that she deſired to be a Chriſtian, and determined to conſerue her virginity, she was condemned to be conſumed with fire.</p>
               <p>The fire was kindled, and a huge multitude of people were aſſembled, to behold that moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull yong damoſell, that would willingly go to dy ſuch a cruell death. The bleſſed damoſell was ſet in the midſt of the fire, which did not any hurt at all vnto her perſons. And on the ſodaine fell from heauen ſuch a ſtorme with thunderclapps, with ſuch aboundance of raine, that it put out the fire, and afrighted all them that were preſent; in ſuch ſort, that euery one departed; and the holy virgin was left at liberty whereby she might go
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:181136:64"/>free. And ſo she went to the houſe of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> where she found S. Paul with ſome other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who had continually (for ſixe daies) made their praiers for her; and they were all exceeding glad of her comming.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle did Baptiſe her and inſtructed her fully in the faith: but becauſe they were aſſured, that the Proconſull would ſend againe for her, the Apoſtle departed from that houſe and citty alſo, recomending much the virgin <hi>Tecla</hi> vnto all the Chriſtians, that were in that place. Though all dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that might be was vſed to keep her ſecret; yet within a fewe dayes, <hi>Alexander</hi> (a lewd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) apprehended her, and brought her before the Proconſull; who ſeing her to preſeuer conſtantly, in that she would not marry her ſpouſe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Chriſtian, gaue ſentence, that she should be deuoured of wilde beaſtes in the citty of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> whether the Proconſull was to go. An eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall daye was apointed for this ſpectacle, and in the meane ſpace S. <hi>Tecla</hi> was deliuered vnto the cuſtody of a matrone called <hi>Triphona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the apointed daie was come, S. <hi>Tecla</hi> was brought into the Theater, and a fierce Lioneſſe was let out againſt her, which drawing neere vnto the holy ſaint, lay downe quietly at her feete, without doing her any harme. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring much at that which the wild beaſted did to the holy virgin, ſaid theſe wordes; The firſtly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which was let out againſt the bleſſed virgin, was mild, lay downe at her feete, and hurt her not; and alſo gaue example vnto the other lyons, Beares and fierce Bulles; who hauing bin let looſe againſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:181136:65"/>her, ſtood round about her peaceably, and licked her feete. The people were ſeuere &amp; cruel; and the ſauage, and wild beaſtes were tame, and pittifull; though they were kept hungry and almoſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that they might haue their fill and make their praie vpon the holy damoſell. And though they were prouoked, and pricked forward by their keepers, that they might deuoure the holy ſaint, yet could they not make them to hurt or harme her in the leaſt degree.</p>
               <p>The Iudge ſeing that the wild beaſtes ſpared her (she being taken out of the Theater) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded she should be caſt into a ditch, wherein were many dreadfull, and venimous ſerpents. when S. <hi>Tecla</hi> was put into that deep ditch there diſcended from heauen a fierie cloud, that ſlewe all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; and by this meanes S. <hi>Tecla</hi> remained free from this third torment, euen as God had deliuered her from the other two, to wit, from the fire and the wild beaſtes.</p>

               </p>
               <p>EVEN as it is no reproch vnto S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſay of him, that he had bene a perſecutor of the Church of God, nor any infamy vnto S. <hi>Matthew,</hi>

               <p>There was in the city of <hi>Antioche</hi> a yong damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, noble of bloud, and faire of face, who was a Chriſtian, and much addcted to vertue and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

At the firſt <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſollicited her with meſſages, letters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and promiſed: but the holy damoſell reſiſted thes aſſaults with a mind determinat, making ſmall account of his profers, and leaſt of all of him. <hi>Cyprian</hi> perceuing this way would not preuaile, thought to obtein his purpoſe, by the help of his magike. So he coniured vp the deuills, and made ſacrifice vnto them, promiſing to be perpetuall frend vnto them, and that he would not worship any other God but them, if they put him in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that damoſell. The deuills (his familiers) hauing gotten this promiſe of him, went to <hi>Iuſtina</hi> and put into her mind filthy thoughts, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt imaginations, which they nourished in her hart: Euery one of the fiends did what they could, to bend and bowe the hart of <hi>Iuſtina</hi> to the loue of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> They repreſented vnto her cogitations a yong man, faire, rich, of courtly behauior, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:181136:67"/>deeply ingaged in her loue. They recalled alſo many times vnto her mynd, the pleaſaunt and amorous words, which he had ſpoken vnto her, of the which she had before made ſmall reconing.</p>
               <p>The holy damoſell perceued the ſtorme, that was raiſed againſt her: and reſorted vnto God for ſuccour, and kneeling in her cloſet, made a deuout praier, beſeeching his heauenly maieſty, that as he had deliuered <hi>Suſanna</hi> from the accurſe Elders,<note place="margin">Dan. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> and S. <hi>Tecla</hi> from her importunate ſpouſe and other holy ſaints both men and women, from other and the like perils, ſo it would pleaſe him, to deliuer her from that daunger, wher in she was at that preſent: She alſo beſought moſt humbly the glorious <hi>Virgin Marie,</hi> that she would help her in that manifeſt perill. Vnto her continuall praiers, she added and adioined faſtings, hair-cloths and ſleeping on the ground, and in the end, by theſe means, she ouercame the temptation, she remained victour, and the deuill vanquished.</p>
               <p>The fiend repleat with confuſion, returned vnto <hi>Cyprian,</hi> &amp; confeſſed, that he had not the power to do any thing againſt <hi>Iuſtina</hi> the virgin: he told him alſo, that the cauſe therof was, becauſe she was a Chriſtian, and that the deuills haue not any power ouer any of them, if they them ſelues do not giue it vnto them. When <hi>Cyprian</hi> heard this, the griefe of his hart cannot be expreſſed: but that was not ſo much for the loue of <hi>Iuſtina,</hi> (becauſe in ſuch like caſes to deſpaire wholly of good ſucceſſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proueth a manifeſt help and remedy) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he perceaued his error, in that he had worsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipped the deuils, who had ſo ſmall power &amp; force.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:181136:67"/>Studieng on this, he determined to abandon and to forſake for euer the deuils, together with their curſed art, and to receaue the Chriſtian faith.</p>
               <p>He conferred his determination with a Bishop who was in that city, called <hi>Antimus,</hi> who inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him to the full in the Chriſtian faith; and Baptiſed him: but firſt and before all this, he made him to burne all the books of Magick, that had. Being Baptiſed; he made it knowen vnto <hi>Iuſtina,</hi> telling her; that vnto her he was much bound, for that by her means he came to the kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledge of the truth, and of the faith of IESVS CHRIST. When <hi>Iuſtina</hi> heard this ſtrange altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, she reioiced excedingly, and would confer ſome times with him, in the which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference they comforted the one the other, to perſeuer in the ſeruice of God, and many by their means were conuerted to the faith, and were Baptiſed.</p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Claudius</hi> 2 was Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> who had ſent a certein <hi>Count,</hi> called <hi>Aurelius,</hi>

When he had examined <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and found him conſtant and firme in the faith, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be ſtripped naked, and his body to be rent &amp; torn with rakes and hooks of Iron he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iuſtina</hi> to be buffetted on the face, and then ſcourged with the rawe ſinews of beaſts.</p>
               <p>After he had put them vnto theſe ſeuerall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

Being taken out they were led backe vnto the priſon: and <hi>Aurelius</hi> hauing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to go vnto <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> tooke order, that the holy martirs should be brought thither, in which place afflicting them with ſondry torments, he laſtly cauſed them to be beheaded.</p>
               <p>Their bodies remained ſixe daies vnburied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none was ſo hardy, as to take them away; but then, certaine Chriſtians conuaied them away in the night, and put them into a bark, and brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght them to <hi>Rome,</hi> where at the firſt they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a farme place belonging to a noble lady, called <hi>Rufina:</hi> and in after times, they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into the city, and buried in the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Constantiniana,</hi> nere vnto the <hi>Fonteſtone.</hi> It is ſaid, that at this preſent, their bodies be in <hi>Placencia,</hi> a city of <hi>Lombardy.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Coſmus and S.

Their father died, when they were yet litly children, wherfore their mother <hi>Theodora</hi> brought them vp with great care and dilligence: And being a woman of good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior, and chiefly, becauſe shee was a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, shee would not permit them to comit any fault or offence, but endeuored to enſtruct and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in vertue and godlines. So that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:181136:69"/>good children, like to their good mother, and good ſchollers, like vnto their good miſtris. Amongſt the other good qualities of theſe two breathren, the profeſſion of the Catholique faith shined moſt in them, for which cauſe, they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed and contemned Idolatry, and other wicked ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>They were chaſt and honeſt in life, and fled from all ſenſuall delight, and tamed their fleſh with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere ſackcloth, diſciplines, and faſtings; which be the moſt certein remedies to ouercome that enemy, euen as they ouercame it by the grace of God. Alſo couetouſnes, that abhominable vice, neuer entred into their hart: but rather, bicauſe they made ſmall account of mony, and liued in poore and meane eſtate, they were called <hi>Anargeni,</hi> which is to ſay <hi>Men without monie,</hi> and in this ſort obſeruing the Ghoſpell, they liued an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call life.</p>
               <p>And to auoid Idlenes, which is the mother of vices, and ſtepmother vnto vertue, they vſed the ſcience of phiſicke euen from theire childhood, &amp; became skilfull, and expert phiſitions. They gaue and miniſtred phiſicke vnto the ſick, without any expectation of temporall gaine, but only for the loue of God. When the infirmity was perillous, and not to be cured by art, they reſorted vnto God by praier, and making the ſigne of the Croſſe, they healed and cured them, and heerein they followed the ſteps of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>They imitated the Patriarcks in being benigne, pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tifull &amp; charitable, in liuing a life in ſimplicity, without doublenes or hypocriſy. They imitated
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:181136:69"/>the Prophets in that they were zelous of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, in reproouing them, that were ſtubborn, and obſtinate in euill deeds: They imitated the martirs in the valiancy of their minds, shewed againſt the common enemies of mankind, the world, the fleſh, and the deuill; They imitated the preiſts in their religious life, chaſtity, and grauity, offering their body and ſoule for an acceptable ſacrifice vnto God, to ſerue him withall humility and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diencence, to obſerue and keepe his holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. They imitated the monks in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, concinency, and pouerty, in ſilence, and repoſe of ſoule. And at one word, they imitated all the ſaints, as much, as lay in their power: Thus they ranne their race, making the world to wonder at their ſincerity, ſo that the report of them was ſpred very farre. The rumor of them being diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed came to the eares of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> thoſe noted perſecutors of the Chriſtians, who had decreed, that all the Iudges, gouernours, lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and other officers of the prouinces ſubiect to them, should put to death all, that denied to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto the Idols. <hi>Liſias</hi> the gouernor in the city of <hi>Egeas,</hi> hauing notice of the bleſſed phiſitions <hi>Coſmus</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> cauſed them to be brought before him, and demaunded of what countrey they were, and their names. They anſwered: that they were <hi>Arabians,</hi> and borne in the city of <hi>Egea,</hi> and that their names were <hi>Coſmus</hi> and <hi>Damian,</hi> and that they were both Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The gouernour perſuaded them, to ſacrifice vnto the Idols: but ſeeing them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly to refuſe it, he commaunded them to be tied hand and foot,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:181136:70"/>and to be cruelly beaten, and after he had giuen them other torments, he cauſed them to be throwne into the maine ſea, bound as they were. They were no ſooner caſt into the water, but an Angell came to their aide, who vntyeng all their hands brought them aliue (and vntied) vnto the shore. The gouernor was certified of that wonder: wherfore he cauſed them ageine to be brought before him, and requeſted them to teach him their Art magicke, and inchauntments, wherby they were deliuered from the ſea, and then he promiſed to be their good friend. They anſwered: We be Chriſtians, and haue no skill in Art magike, but were deliuered our of the ſea, by the power of our Lord IESVS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>The gouernor cauſed them againe to be put in priſon, and the next day a great fire to be kindled: then he threw the bleſſed martirs into the ſame: but the flame was deuided into two parts, and the holy ſaints remained in the midſt at their praiers. The gouernor was aſtonied to ſee ſuch a wonder, yet he did not repent of his wickednes, but cauſed them to be hoiſed aloft, and to be beaten againe with wands and ſtones: and beholding the holy ſaints cheerefull in countenaunce, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the torments, he cauſed them to be lifted vpon two Croſſes, and there to be ſtoned to death.</p>
               <p>The officers threw the ſtones, and though they caſt them with all their might, yet came none of the ſtones ſo farre as the holy martirs; but fell vpon them, that ſtood by to ſee the ſpectacle, and wounded many of them, but eſpecially them tha threw them. The gouernour ſeeing this, (an
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:181136:70"/>beleeuing aſſuredly, that it was done by inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) enraged with fury and indignation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to be shot to death with Arrowes, and the ſame happened to the Arrowes, as did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto the ſtones, for they did light on them, that shot them, and none touched the bodies of the martires. At laſt, he commaunded they should be both beheaded: and in this ſort, the holy martirs finished their lifes, and obteined the crowne of Martirdome: Their bodies were buried by ſome vertuous people, with out the walles of the city <hi>Egea.</hi>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:181136:71"/>was not a man in all the army, that was ſo hardy, as to behold the face of the giant: only the lowly litle shepherd</hi> Dauid, <hi>zelous of the kings honour, and of the peoples alſo, tooke on him the enterpriſe to combat with the Philiſtean: which he did; and shewed ſuch valour, that with a ſtone which he threw, he hitte him on the forhead, and felled him to the ground: then he ranne ſpeedily vnto him, and out of his head, and returned with the ſame, euery one making triumph for his victory, but eſpecially the damſels declared his proweſſe in a ſong. After this king</hi> Saul <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued his promiſe, he made him a noble man, and a great officer in his court, and gaue vnto him his daughter</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol <hi>vnto his wife.</hi>

                  <hi>This is a perfect portraict of the battell, which was in heauen, between the Angels: of which it is good the memory be celebrated, as often as their feaſt is ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; for that, which they did, was a famous and rare work. The Philiſtean</hi> Golias <hi>is a figure of</hi> Lucifer, <hi>who was the higheſt Angell, and ſeing himſelf endowed with grace and guifts, aboue other Angel, was puffed in pride, and came into the field againſt God, pretending to be like and equall to him in ſome things. It was not fit, God should come into the field againſt him, for then the victory would haue bene of farre leſſe eſtimation: but</hi> S. Michaell <hi>figured by the lowely shepherd</hi> Dauid <hi>tooke on him this entrepriſe, and entred boldy into the field againſt</hi> Lucifer, <hi>in the defence of Gods honor; and behaued himſelf ſo well, that with one ſtone, (which was his profound humility, ſaieng</hi> who is as God?) <hi>he cast the giant to the earth, that is, threw</hi> Lucyfer <hi>into hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lucifer <hi>being ouercome with all his followers.</hi> S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaell <hi>returned victoriouſly from the conflict, euery one
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:181136:72"/>making ioy and triumph for it, but eſpecially the damſels, who ſang of his proweſſe: which happeneth euery time, this feaſt of him and the Angels is celebrated, for that many bleſſed ſoules ſinging the victory of</hi> S. Michaell, <hi>do reioice at his honorable enterpriſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God alſo performed his promiſe vnto him, he made him a noble man and gaue him an honorable office, making him Chief Iuſtice in his kingdome, (for which cauſe, he beareth the Ballaunce and the ſword in his hand, when he is painted) and gaue vnto him an honorable companion which was his diuine grace, confirming him in the ſame, and all the other bleſſed ſpirits alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>EVERY time, the Catholike Church celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the feaſt of the Angels, there is red in the office of the maſſe a ghoſpell, which treateth howe controuerſy ariſing amongſt the Apoſtles, which of them should be the greateſt, the ſonne of God called a litle child, and ſet him in the midſt of them and ſaid: <hi>If you be not humbled as this child, you shall not be great in the kingdome of heauen,</hi> but more then that, <hi>You shall neuer come thither.</hi> The vſe of the Catholike Church guided by the holy Ghoſt is to reade this Ghoſpell in ſuch like ſolemnities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is mention made of the Angels: for in the end therof it is ſaid: That, <hi>None should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the lowely and humble, (as children be) bicauſe their Angels ſee alwaies in heauen the face of God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Authors, (though not in the literall ſence) will drawe this hiſtory to the Angels; ſaieng that aſſoone as God created them; he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notice of the miſtery of the Incarnation, and ſet before their eies that B. child IESVS, who should giue remedy vnto the world, and then ſaid vnto them: uerily I
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:181136:72"/>tel you, if you be not humble &amp; lowely as this child and imitate him therin, if in this ſmall space, in which you be <hi>viatores,</hi> or trauellors, and haue time to merite or demerite, yee do not imitate him, and be likened to this child; If you do not honor and adore him, you shall not be confirmed in grace, you shall not enter into my glory.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſeeing him felf ſo faire, beutifull, and honoured, iudged it would be an abacement, and vility to imitate a man, and much more to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him. And labouring to drawe the Angels vnto his opinion, ſaid vnto them: it would be a great baſenes and shame vnto them, to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to adore a man, and with theſe ſpeechs drew the third part vnto his opinion.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Michael</hi> (together with all the other holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) obeied God, and adored the litle child IESVS: and tooke vpon him the defence of Gods honor, againſt <hi>Lucifer</hi> and the Angels that followed him. The fierce warre betweene them was not of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall weapons, but of different willes, and <hi>S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> and his company were ſo potent, that they caſt <hi>Lucifer</hi> and all his followers out of heauen. Aſſoone as <hi>Lucifer</hi> was caſt out of heauen, &amp; fallen into the world, there was heard a great voice which ſaid: wo vnto the world becauſe <hi>Lucifer</hi> is fallen into it, and will giue occaſion of offence, but more <hi>wo vnto him, by whom ſuch ſcandals shall come, it were better for ſuch a one to haue a millſtone tied vnto his necke, and that he were throwen into the ſea.</hi> This befell vnto the deuill, becauſe there was tied vnto the neck of his will a greate ſtone, which was their obſtinacy; with which they were drowned in the

This is that, which ſome doctors ſay, (and I had not reherſed it here, if it had not a good ground) that the ſinne of <hi>Lucifer</hi> was, for that he would not adore IESVS CHRIST. for he thought he loſt much of his reputation, if he that was an Angell, had abaſed himſelf to adore IESVS CHRIST a man, though he was God alſo.</p>
               <p>It is the common opinion of the doctors, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon holy writte, that the ſinne of <hi>Lucifer</hi> was pride and diſobedience. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth to ſay ſo, writing to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Let all the Angels of God adore him.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith: that this was a precept giuen vnto the Angels.

                  </note> and becauſe the curſed wretch cannot reuenge himſelf againſt him, there fore he laboureth to wreak his malice againſt men. wherupon S. <hi>Baſill</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">D.

               <p>On the contrary, the Angels do loue men enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, bicauſe they ſee CHRIST, who is both God and man for whoſe cauſe they enioy the heuenly glory: and alſo becauſe they behould the deuils to perſecute and make cruell warre againſt them.

Then went he vnto the ſtudy of philoſophy, and other liberall arts, and in them he profited much, as appeareth by his writings.

                  <hi>S.

About the middeſt of Lent, a grieuous feuer tooke me, and brought me to that ſtate of body, that they who were with me, prepared for my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall. Remaining thus: I was taken vp in ſpirite, and brought vnto iudgment, before the roiall throne of IESVS CHRIST; and being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of my quality, and of my faith, I aunſwered boldly, that I was a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Then the Iudge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:181136:77"/>Nay, thou ſeemeſt rather to be a <hi>Ciceronian,</hi> then a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> for where thy treaſure is, there is thy hart. At this word, I was ſtrooke dombe, and the Iudge commanded me to be cruelly beaten. I ſighing and ſobbing ſaid: <hi>Pardon me ô Lord; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me ô Lord:</hi> neuertheles my punishment endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and my teares continewed. many Angells (who were preſent) ſeing it, fell on their knees before the Iudge, beſeeching him to pardon me the errours of my youth, and to giue me time alſo of amendment: vpon condition, that if I did not amend my fault, I should vndergo a greater punishment. I would at that time, and in that eſtate haue promiſed greater things: &amp; ſo I did ſweare to obſerue this: which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had done, I was ſet free, and came to my ſelf. Let none think it was a vaine dreame; witnes is the iudge in whoſe ſight I was beaten, the Angells be alſo witneſſes, and ſo be the marks of the ſcourging, which continued in my body for many daies.</p>
               <p>From that time S. <hi>Ierome</hi> addicted himſelf vnto the ſtudy of Diuinity; and ſpent not his time any more in other vnprofitable and vaine ſtudies: and therfore he ſaith in the prologue before <hi>S. Paul</hi> vnto the <hi>Galathians:</hi> It is 15. yeares, ſince I took in my hand any book of ſecular learning; and if it happen ſometime, that I neede the ſcience of any ſuch books, I take it out of my memory. Writing to <hi>Damaſus</hi> the pope, he reproueth eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that leaue the reading of holy writt, and ſpend their time in reading of heathnish books and fables, which do hurt vnto many.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ierome</hi> thought it time, to ſet downe his reſt,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:181136:78"/>and to followe ſome courſe of life. And ſeing, that in the eccleſiaſticall ſtate there was daunger, for the great obligement they haue to be good, and to ſeeme to be ſo alſo, by giuing good example to all: ſeing likewiſe the great charge they had that took wifes, he refuſed this vtterly, and feared to aſſume the other vpon him. So he reſolued, to be a monk.</p>
               <p>Their order at that time was, to weare a meane and courſe garment, different from the clergy and the lay men: yet did not all the monks vſe one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of appareill; for they differed in the ſtuf, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and alſo in the fashion: for ſome of them were clothed with courſe and rough cloth, others with beaſts skinns, ſowed together; but in this they all agreed, that their garments were courſe, bare, and very meane. They exerciſe themſelues continually in faſting, watching, and reading of the holy ſcriptures; they could not haue any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique office; but all their buſines was to ſerue God. Some of them liued in common, and had a ſuperior, vnto whom they gaue obedience. others liued a ſolitary life in the deſerts, and S. <hi>Ierome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take that kind of life.</p>
               <p>He had ſome frends, vntowhom he diſcloſed his minde, and what his determination was to do. They, although they had followed him vntill that time (and had receaued comfort of his holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation aboundantly, and had profitted much by his hole ſome aduiſes, and by the example of his holy life) yet at that pinch, they all abandoned him: only one called <hi>Eliodorus</hi> ſtaid and took the habite, &amp; remained within him in the deſert a short time; but being tired and aweried &amp; not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:181136:78"/>that auſterity of life, he alſo forſook him, and returned vnto the world. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> wrote of this departure of <hi>Eliodorus</hi> vnto <hi>Iulian</hi> the deacon, in theſe gratious words. Our brother <hi>Eliodorus</hi> came vnto the deſert with me, and for that he is holy, and I a great ſinner, and he not being able to ſuport my maners, is departed, and left me. Aſſoone as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> had taken this courſe of life, he ſet his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall goods in order, and recommended the charge of them to an honeſt man.</p>
               <p>During the time he ſtaied in the deſert, he ſtaid not long in a place; becauſe at that time, certain hereſies were diſperſed in thoſe countries, and the prelats of <hi>Antioche, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Cypres</hi> and of other places, vnder whoſe iurisdiction the monks, and ſolitary liuers were, ſent ordinarily viſiters to examine them of their faith. Theſe viſiters had no truſt in S. <hi>Ierome;</hi> and he had no confidenee in them. He was ſuſpitious of them, becauſe of ſome words and phraſes they vſed, in the miſtery of the <hi>B. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. <hi>77</hi> ad mar. Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> and they ſuſpected him, becauſe their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and company did not like and pleaſe him. To free himſelf of this moleſtation, and to auoid the often viſitations of his friends, who kept him more occupied, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he deſired to be; he withdrew himſelf into a deſert and ſolitary wildernes in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> and there he shutvp himſelf with his books in a caue, where he remained foure years, doing pennance, and leading an auſtere life.</p>
               <p>His chief exerciſe was to lament the ſinnes of his youth, to chaſtice his body with faſting, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and other auſterities, that it would make a man to wonder at them, ſooner then to imitate
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:181136:79"/>them. Rawe herbes and roots were his meat; faire water was his drink, &amp; the bare ground was his bed. he was neuer Idle, nowe he ſtudied, then he praied, and when he felt him ſelf awearied, he ſong himnes to the praiſe and glory of God. This was the life of this holy ſaint: and though it was thus, yet the deuill aſſalted him with terrible and wicked temptations.</p>
               <p>He ſaith himſelf,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ep</hi> 22.</note> writing to <hi>Euſtochium,</hi> in this maner: O howe many times, when I was in the deſert, (where, by the vnmeaſurable heate of the ſunne, men are ſcorched, their bodies enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, their flesh burned &amp; conſumed) ſtretching my bones, which ſcarce hong together, on the bare ground, taking for nutryment herbs and cleare water (and thus I continued in this exile, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priſon, vnto which I had voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned my ſelf for dread of hell, and had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company, but the ſauage beaſts) how often thought I that I was at the daunces of the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of <hi>Rome?</hi> my face was pale with much faſting, and yet my will was enkindled with wanton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. In the body cold as ice, yet in my dry skinne, which was in manner dead, liued the motions of dishoneſt appetits: and when I reſiſted and thought to oppreſſe them, thy laboured ſtil to bud and encreaſe, like weedes and bad herbs. Sometimes finding my ſelf abandoned, I fell at the knees of my Lord, and washed them with my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares, and dried them with my haires; I macerated my body with long faſting day by day, and eating nothing. Do not think, that I am a shamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe this ſtory of my temptations, yea I lament,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:181136:79"/>that I am not nowe, as I was them. I do remember that I haue ſometime ſpent the night in praier, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on my LORD IESVS CHRIST; neither did I ceaſe to knock my breaſt, vntill that my hart was at reſt, from thoſe vnquiet thoughts. IESVS CHRIST is my witnes, that after all theſe trobles, I felt great conſolation and content, teares, as ſweet as hony, with ſuch enkindled and louely deſires of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that me thought, I was tranſported beyond my ſelf, and that I was aboue the Quiers of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells. If the flesh make ſuch warre againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that afflict and torment it, what will it do to him, that liueth in pleaſure &amp; delights? It may be, he shall not haue ſuch terrible temptations: But in that caſe, I thinke, there is no greater temptation, then not to be tempted.</p>
               <p>This ſame holy Doctour writing to <hi>Pammachius,</hi> ſaith: I exalt virginity, but not, for that I do enioy it, but for that I highly eſteeme them, that do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it.

Yet as it appeareth by an epiſtle vnto <hi>Eustochium,</hi> he neuer did actually commit and dishoneſty: and theſe be

               <p>After that S. <hi>Ierome</hi> had bene foure years in the afore-named deſert,<note place="margin">in vit. eius</note> he thought, he might nowe, yea that he ought to go out, &amp; preache vnto the people: yet for all he did not vtterly renounce and forſake the deſert, but retired into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of relligious men, to liue among them. It was not fitt ſuch a light should be hid any longer, but should be knowen. for the relligious men, with whom he conuerſed, and enioied his bleſſed company, perceued the great treaſure that God had ſafly kept vnder that courſe clothing in the breſt of <hi>Ierome,</hi> repleat with ſcience and doctrine. He had before that time written ſome works, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished them. Theſe books were well liked of the readers, who bare good affection alſo to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor for the ſame, and by this meanes S. <hi>Ierome</hi> came to be knowen in many places.</p>
               <p>There liued at that time <hi>Epiphanius</hi> B of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi> in <hi>Cipres,</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> B of <hi>Antioche.</hi> Theſe two prelats were at controuerſy, and to be agreed, they were to go to <hi>Rome</hi> vnto the Pope.<note place="margin">Ep <hi>16.</hi> in ep i. taph. mar celle: v.ep <hi>27</hi> in. epitap paule.</note> In this their iourney they took S. <hi>Ierome</hi> with them in their company, for the good opinion they had of him.

And becauſe he was alredy made

                  </note> the pope gaue vnto him the title of a church in <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Laurence,</hi> which is the ſame, as it is nowe to be a Cardinall: though they did not then vſe the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and the red hatte, which pope <hi>Innocent.</hi> 4. about the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 1250. gaue vnto them. So that to paint S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in the habite of a <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> hath this foundation; that indeed he was a <hi>Cardinall,</hi> in that he was a prieſt, and Curate of a parish in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The glorious S. <hi>Ierome</hi> exercized this charge carefully and diligently, and laboured to roote out publique offendors out of his parish, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued them sharply, though they were of the Cleargy, which cauſed him to be perſecuted and hated: for it is an ordinary matter for the wicked, to abhorre and deteſt the good and the vertuous, euen as the dogge doth hate the ſtaffe that beateth him. So thoſe, that in their lifes were like beaſts, and in their deeds were diſordered and vnruly people, hated S. <hi>Ierome:</hi> for he was the ſtaff and the ſcourge that whipped them. Whervpon they awaited, to eſpy out ſome occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſlaunder him, and to driue him out of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they did indeed at laſt. Their meanes was this: S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vſed, when he preached the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to forſake vices, to loue vertues, to deſpiſe the world, and to make none account of the pompe and vaine glory therof</p>
               <p>Alitle before this time were fled vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> from the fury of the Arryans ſome Catholique prieſts of <hi>Egipt,</hi> as S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and others: who told how in thoſe countreis S. <hi>Antony,</hi> &amp; other holy
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:181136:81"/>hermits had made monaſteries, aſwell of men, as women, who ſerued God, by liuing in obedience, pouerty, and chaſtity. Some Romaine Ladies hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, had a deſire to do the ſame: and becauſe the prieſts, who should haue animated them therin, were gon back vnto their owne country, for that thy heard the perſecution was ceaſed, they were hindered from building the monaſtery, as they deſired to haue done. and finding S. <hi>Ierome</hi> to fauor their intent, as a thing agreable to that which he preached and taught and alſo proffer to defend them from all that did depraue, or backbite the act, for they feared him much, as alſo to ſpeak in their behalf to pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> who loued him dearely, they builded vp the monaſtery they deſired. The ladies, that began this laudable work, were <hi>Sophronia, Marcella, Melania, Paula</hi> and <hi>Euſtochium:</hi> and many others followed &amp; imitated them.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ierome</hi> inſtructed them all in the way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he willed them to read ſpirituall books, to pray often, to be humble, charitable, and chaſt: but eſpecially, to frequent often the ſacraments of Confeſſion and of the Euchariſt. Theſe and ſuch like were the perſuaſions S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vſed to theſe deuout wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe he deſired their encreaſe in holy life. And though this cauſed in <hi>Rome</hi> ſome murmuring, as being a thing vnuſuall, yet then ſeeing how theſe relligious women profitted in vertue, and how ſome that were before gadders abroad, delighting in gay and rich appareill, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, and vanities, and idle talking, were now quite changed from theſe thinge, and ſeemed to be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:181136:81"/>the bleſſed handmaids of God, the murmure cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yea S. <hi>Ierome</hi> was extolled, and highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as the diuiſer of this holy work.</p>
               <p>When he paſſed by the ſtreets, the people kiſſed his garments, and ſaid openly that when <hi>Damaſus</hi> died, he should be his ſucceſſor. This was the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache of euery one in generall: yet ſome priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wished him euill, and ſought to wreak their malice on him, becauſe he did publikely reprooue theire faults.</p>
               <p>At laſt they took this occaſion to ſlaunder him. The religious women being many, it was expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r, that they should be in diuers places, and we may think, that <hi>Sophronia, Marcella, Melania,</hi> and <hi>Paula,</hi> had them home to their houſes, and that in thoſe places they vſed their holy exercizes. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited them oftentimes, and came vnto the houſes, where they remained, for at that time, they had no grates, nor any ſuch incloſures, as the Nonnes of our time haue, which is done with great diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wiſedome, let heretiks bark therat, as much as they will, for thereby are auoided and preuented many inconuenientes. Well: S. <hi>Ierome</hi> viſited all theſe relligious women, but he went more to the houſe of <hi>Paula,</hi> then to any other place, for there (as it was apparaunt afterward) was moſt vertue, and good life to be found.</p>
               <p>The enemies of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> at theſe often viſitations took occaſion to ſlaunder, and murmure at him, and ſaid; it was not well done, as they thought: for though <hi>Paula</hi> was old, <hi>Ierome</hi> was not old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then but. 40. years of age, and moreouer, there was <hi>Euſtochium</hi> the daughter of <hi>Paula,</hi> and other
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:181136:82"/>yong women, in the houſe. They ment that, by the other relligious women, which were in the houſe of <hi>Paula,</hi> and by her maides and waiting women: for <hi>Paula</hi> and the religious women, that remained with her, were of the richeſt and chiefeſt Ladies in <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe enemies of <hi>S.

               <p>I know not, nor cannot imagine (noble lady) what thanks I am to yield vnto you for the great affection you beare vnto me, for our lordes ſake God is able to render vnto thy ſoule, the reward it deſerueth: although I am, (as ſome think) a

               <p>There was neuer a lady in <hi>Rome,</hi> that could get me to viſite her, or to come vnto her houſe, but shee only, who with lamenting and faſting, had made her face wanne and pale, &amp; her eyes litle bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then blind: shee that was ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in praier, that many times at the ſunne ſetting, and at the ſunne riſing in the morning she was ſtill at her prayer. Her ballers were hymness, her words were the holy Ghoſpel, her delights were chaſtity, and her life a perpetuall faſting. None could pleaſe me, but she, that I neuer ſawe eating. Aſſone as I began to honor her, for her deſerued vertues, I ſtraite was abandoned of vertue, in the eyes of the enuyous: O enuy, that firſt doeſt bite and tear thy ſelfe? O the malice of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who ceaſeth not to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vertue and ſanctity.</p>
               <p>I haue written vnto thee theſe few words, in haſt, (being nowe entred into the shippe,) but not without teares, &amp; grief at my hart: yet do I render thanks vnto my God for graunting me this fauor, that I am abhorred of the world. Make thy prayers vnto our lord for me, that when I am gone out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he would guide me in peace vnto <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> leſt that <hi>Nabucodonozor</hi> enthrall me. Some call me inchaunter, and ſo was our Sauior called, but the ſeruant cannot be greater then his maiſter. Others ſay that I am a deceiuer, the ſame was ſaid vnto <hi>S. Paule</hi> the Apoſtle. My ſoule feeleth great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation in this, that we are to enter into heauen by good report, and by infamy. Theſe and other things <hi>S. Ierome</hi> wrote in that epiſtle, by which may be knowen the occaſions of this departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> to wit: becauſe his aduerſaries ceaſed not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:181136:83"/>to ſlaunder him.</p>
               <p>Being departed thence, he paſſed into <hi>Siria,</hi> &amp; viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Epiphanius B</hi> of <hi>Cypres,</hi> &amp; <hi>Paulinus</hi> B. of <hi>Antioche,</hi> his two great fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, who had brought him to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; left him there, they departing aſſone as pope <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus</hi> had accorded their variaunce. <hi>S.

It may be that shee cauſed the monaſtery, which S, <hi>Ierome</hi> had built before to be enlarged and made bigger. <hi>S. Ierome</hi> was the ſuperior, and gouerned the monaſtery of men, and <hi>Paula</hi> gouerned the other three made for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; being ſo diſcreet and holy, that she ruled thoſe three in good ſort, dwelling now in the one, and then in another.</p>
               <p>There S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ended the writing of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables works, which the church keepeth and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:181136:84"/>at this day. He tranſlated the Bible viz: the old teſtament out of the Hebrew into latine: thee newe teſtament out of Greek into latine: and wrote commentaries out of Greek into latine: and wrote commentaries on the greateſt part there of, and expounded it excellently. His books being ſpread through the world (beſide the many epiſtles, which he wrote almoſt with out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, vnto ſondy perſons) cauſed euery one to find and knowe his ſanctity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found doctrine; and to accept and account him for a very good and ſound Catholike; for ſome had at the firſt doubt therof, by cauſe of that, which <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his aduerſary wrote againſt him. One of theſe was <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> who at the firſt had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt in him, but afterward, he bare vnto him ſuch loue and affection, that being Bishop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> he ſent one of his truſty friends called <hi>Alipius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his prieſts to viſite him, on his behalf; and to be inſtructed by him, reputing it for a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and credit (knowing as he knewe) to be the diſciple of the diſciples of S. <hi>Ierome.</hi> There went perſons of great account from all countreys to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite him, as <hi>Paulus Oroſius</hi> did, (who was alſo ſent by <hi>S. Augustine) Seuerus Sulpitius, Apodemius,</hi> and other rare and renoumed men. And though the voyage was long, and the daunger great, yet all that ſeemed a ſmall thing, to ſee thee venerable old man <hi>S. Ierome,</hi> replenished with ſanctity and learning.</p>
               <p>This holy doctor wrote inceſſantly againſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceticks, and perſecuted them with out any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, and they were afrayd, and trembled to heare him named. <hi>Origen</hi> had written many books
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:181136:84"/>before the time of <hi>S. Ierome,</hi> all which he read, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great delight in his delicate and fine witt, and for affection called him his teacher; but for all that he did not pardon nor ſpare the errors he found in his books: yea, he impugned them to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his ability. <hi>S. Ierome</hi> was ſubiect to many infirmities cauſed by continuall ſtudy, and the hard auſterity he had vſed to ward his body: ſo that ſome times he remayned whole years bedrid; yet ceaſed he not, but endited to others that wrote, ſo that he compoſed many books, being occupied in that exercize 30. years, as he writeth himſelf.</p>
               <p>The countrey of <hi>Greece</hi> did much honour this glorious doctor, by tranſlating the works he wrote in latine into the Greek toung.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid by S. <hi>Ierome</hi> that as he red one day vnto his diſciples (wherof he had many in ordinary, from many parts) there entred into his ſchoole or place of lecture a lyon halting. All the ſchollers ranne away; but the holy doctor receued him without dread. when the lyon came neere, he lifted vp, and shewed one of his forefeet wounded with a thorne, which was runne into his foot, and the holy man dreſſed it, and when it was hole, the lyon would not depart, but attended in the monaſtery; as if he had bene tame and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. This ſtory I tell, becauſe he is painted with a lyon by him.</p>
               <p>It is alſo ſaid: that <hi>S. Ierome</hi> apointed thereto by <hi>Damaſus</hi> the pope, ſet in order the office of the Church, diuiding the pſalmes for euery day of the week, and apointing that euery one should end with this verſicle: <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sicut erat</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:181136:85"/>He apointed alſo the Epiſtles and Ghoſpells for all the yeare, with the lectures, and prophecies that are red in the office of the maſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Ierome</hi> being employed in theſe holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and ſuch like, in aunſwering, and aſſoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling douts, which Bishops, and other relligious perſons ſent vnto him, from all parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and alſo in giuing aduiſe to people that were in neceſſity; he came vnto ſuch perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he was rapt and tranſlated ſome times in ſpirite, among the Quiers of Angells; and began in this life, to taſt the reward of his paine and traueill, though there remained ſome other afflictions for his old age, which was a feeblenes, that he could not riſe from his bed: and, as <hi>Sigibertus</hi> ſaith, he had a corde tied to a piece of wood ouer his bed, and he held by that, when he deſired to turne from one ſide vnto the other.</p>
               <p>His infirmity encreaſing, and he knowing the hower of his death approched, commaunded the B. Sacrament to be brought vnto him, and then communicated with great deuotion: which when he had done, he yielded vp his ſpirite vnto God on the 30. day of <hi>September,</hi> about the year of our Lord 422. <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond being Emperours. <hi>Marianus victorius</hi> in the life of <hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſaith: that this holy <hi>Doctor</hi> dyed at the age of 99. years, as ſome Authors hold, for ſome others ſay otherwiſe. It is moſt true and aſſured, that he liued till his decrepit age, as <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith in the firſt book againſt <hi>Iulianus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His bleſſed body was buryed in <hi>Bethleham,</hi> and after ward in proceſſe of time, it was brought to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:181136:85"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> and laid in the Chuch of <hi>S. Maria ad preſepe.</hi> which at this day is called <hi>S. Maria Maior. God</hi> shewed many miracles by meanes of this holy ſaint aſwell in his life as after his death. The Church accounteth him for one of the foure <hi>Doctors,</hi> and maketh a great feaſt of him, and eſpecially in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> for that there he ſtudied, there he was Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and there reſteth his bleſſed body.</p>
               <p>It is alſo very fit that <hi>fraunce</hi> should keep it fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiuall, for there he was a good ſpace, and ſawe the principall places of that king dome: <hi>Germany</hi> is alſo obliged in like maner vnto <hi>S.

Egipt is alſo deeply in his debt, for that it enioyed a long time his company and bleſſed conuerſation.</p>
               <p>The deſerts of <hi>Siria</hi> are in the ſame debt. for the auſtere penance <hi>S. Ierome</hi> did there, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate and make them famous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bethlehem</hi> shalbe reconed in this account: yea and we may call it happy for two reſpects; firſt and principally, becauſe our lord and Sauyor IESVS CHRIST was borne therin, when he came to liue in this world: and alſo, but in farre lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for the <hi>S. Ierome</hi> dyed there to liue in heauen.</p>
               <p>But aboue all other prouinces <hi>Spaine</hi> oweth an eſpeciall duety vnto S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> for the many epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles he wrote to particular perſons therin, as alſo for that after many hundreth years that he dyed in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> it ſeemed, he was raiſed to life in <hi>Spaine:</hi> not he in perſon, but his name and religion. for in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:181136:86"/>the time of Pope <hi>Gregory.</hi> II. the king <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> the. II. raigning in <hi>Spaine,</hi> there came out of <hi>Italy</hi> two holy hermites into the kingdome of <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spaine:</hi> and by their good example of life, and holy admonitions, others were conuerted vnto that holy religious order. <hi>Don alonſe Peccia Bishop</hi> of <hi>Iaen,</hi> and <hi>Petro fernandez Peccia</hi> his brother, and <hi>Hernando Laguez</hi> chief chaplen of the kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel &amp; Chanon of Toledo, who being elected Arch-Bishop therof, refuſed that dignity: &amp; beſide theſe many other noble men of marke and quality.</p>
               <p>Many of the before named choſe that life, for that they had conceyued a great dread and fear of the king <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who at that time reigned in <hi>Caſtile</hi> (after the death of the king <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> his father) becauſe he had a delight to shed mans bloud; ſo much, that if the offence or fault were neuer ſo ſmall, he cauſed very rigorous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted vpon the delinquents: which ſeuere kind of Iuſtice was not vſed to be excuted in <hi>Spaine</hi> Wherefore the king gained thereby the ſurname of <hi>Cruell</hi> to this day. I cannot tell, if the doing of his Chronicler who did ſmally befrend him, (as it ſeemeth for ſome priuat reſpect) did not help forward to ſettle &amp; confirme that odious name of <hi>Cruell</hi> vnto him, from that time vnto this.</p>
               <p>All these liued together certein years in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. then they beſought Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> to giue them a habite and a rule vnder the name of the hermitts of S. <hi>Ierome:</hi> but the Pope gaue vnto them the rule of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> the name and habite they haue at this daie. This order was confirmed in the third yeare of the Popedome of. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> on S. <hi>Lukes</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:181136:86"/>daie in the yeare of our <hi>Lord</hi> 1373.</p>
               <p>The order which is called in <hi>Spaine</hi> of the <hi>Iſidori</hi> which is alſo of S. <hi>Ierome</hi> was inſtituted in the time of <hi>Pope Martin the 5.</hi> by <hi>frier Lopes de Ouiedo,</hi> profeſſor of the monaſterie of <hi>Guada Lupe,</hi> who out of S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> workes tooke a rule, which is printed with his other workes. and with the helpe of ſome that deſired to followe it, and with licence from the <hi>ſea Apaſtolike,</hi> he founded certaine monaſteries in <hi>Italy,</hi> which are called <hi>Iſidori,</hi> or the <hi>congregation</hi> of <hi>frier Lopes.</hi> Of the firſt named relligious men of the order of S. <hi>Ierome</hi> there be in <hi>Spaine</hi> many worthie mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, but in eſpeciall fifteene which are called. <hi>Royall,</hi> becauſe alwaies they haue bin fauoured by the kings. They were eſpecially fauoured by the Catholique king <hi>don Phillip the ſecond</hi> of that name who built them a monaſtery an college in the <hi>Eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi> vnder the title of S. <hi>Laurence</hi> the <hi>Royall,</hi> and the rule &amp; inſtitution of the glorious <hi>S.

               <p>By theſe and other the great and coſtlie things in this Royall houſe, euidentlie appeareth the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid king <hi>Don Phillip</hi> toward the glorious Doctors S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> and his bleſſed religious order. wherefore we maie hope that the ſame ſaint wilbe his good aduocate vnto God, that his Royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <p>
                  <hi>Montanus</hi> went and acquainted them whith his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:181136:88"/>reuelation, whereof both had ſome doubt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that both were ſtricken in yeares: but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <hi>Cilinia</hi> could not be induced to belieue it.

The vertue of this ſainct did shine so cleerely in his childhood, that, euen in the day break of his life, he plainelie declared, how great would be the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of his perfect age. He was ſent to ſchoole; where, in a short ſpace, he did not onlie profitte much in knowledge and learning, but allſo in holie and vertuous life: making learning to ſerue as a light to guide him in the path of vertue; &amp; vertue by alaying the ſtormes of paſſions, further him in the courſe of learning. when he came vnto the age of. 22. years <hi>Bennadius</hi> the Archbishop of the city deceaſing, the people aſſembled for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of another paſtour. and fixing their eyes on that holie Saint there preſent, ſayed there was not any more fitte them <hi>Remigius,</hi> to ſucceed in that dignity.</p>
               <p>The holy yong man being there, was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled much in mind, &amp; made many excuſes; ſaieng, that ſoe eminent a degree was full vnſeemely for one of his age, and conuerſation; that the vſage was, not to elect beardles youths to an office con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:181136:89"/>only for men well ſtricken in years, or of a conſiſtent age. Vnto theſe allegations they made aunſwere, that his vertues ſupplied the defects of his age, and therefore they had determined, that he should be their Paſtour and prelate.

               <p>The wonderfull maruaill of the celeſtiall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and confirmation of S. <hi>Rimigius</hi> in the prelacy proceeded further: for beſide the light, his head was found to be washed with a heauenly dewe or liqour, and all they, which were preſent, felt the moſt fragrant and ſweet ſmell, that might be, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the ſame. All the people, beholding this wonder, with one voice praiſed God, and gaue him thanks, that he had vouchſaued to shew plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely, that the election they had made was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him. S. <hi>Remigius</hi> durſt not make any further reſiſtance, leaſt it should ſeeme that he withſtood and gaine ſaid the will of God. So he was made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and conſecrated Bishop by the other Bishops that dwellt there about.</p>
               <p>Aſſoone as he had accepted this high function, he made euident demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration, that he was of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ability to exerciſe the ſame: he shewed him ſelf to be an almoſe giuer, vigilant, deuout, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, perfect in doctrine and charity; his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was celeſtiall; his words were all kindled with the fier or Gods loue. He was affable, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais pleaſant in countenance, but with grauity: his preaching was of that which was neceſſary for
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:181136:89"/>ſaluation of ſoules. &amp; what he preached in words, he practiſed in works. He moued them, that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on his face earneſtly, to deuotion; for in him did shine clearly the liuely portraiture of ſantity. His ſight was dreafull and awfull vnto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and proud; but very mild and gratious vnto the lowly and humble: Toward goodmen his aſpect was louing and pleaſing, as S. <hi>Peters</hi> was: but to the wicked his countenannce was grimme and ſtern, like vnto S. <hi>Paules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The riches of his ſoule were ſo great, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſtanding they could not be ſeen with corporall eies, nor expreſſed in words; yet were they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by his externall works. He fled Idlenes; and worldly pleaſures were to him diſpleſant: &amp; on the other ſide, trauaile was to him beſt pleaſing, and he had a delight to be contemned. In his ſermons he did eſpecially reprehend the vice of carnallity, and willed his hearers not to account their owne wifes foule: or to think the wife of another man faire or beautifull. He was in diet temperate; and he ſometimes, (becauſe he would not ſeeme hautey or proud,) called ſome of his poor kindred and freinds to his table.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the litle birds were ſeen to flye in at the windoes, and to ſit on the tables ſide, or on the platter, and he gaue them ſome what to eate, and when ſome flewe away, others came back. At this S. <hi>Remigius</hi> took occaſion to giue ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vnto the gueſts that ſate at his table, ſaieng. See, theſe bitle birds do not ſowe nor reape nor haue no granaries wherin to conſerue their goods; and yet God doth not abandon them, but
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:181136:90"/>prouideth for them day by day; how much more will he prouide for man, for whoſe ſake he shed his precious bloud, and loſt his life? ought not man therefore endeuor to do the will of God, and be vnto him obedient, as theſe litle birds be? He ſaid alſo: This meat was not dreſſed and ordained for theſe litle birds, euen ſo, the goods which our fore fathers haue left vs, or that we haue gotten by our labour and traueill, we ought to beſtowe part thereof cheerefully among poor men; to the end God may make vs partakers of his glory in his kingdome, out of the which the deuills were caſt for their offence. This good Prelate viſited often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his Bishoprik in perſon, and committed not the ſame vnto any other.</p>
               <p>It happened that on a time, he came vnto a place called <hi>Calmaciacum:</hi> there was a man poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of an euill ſpirit, which made him alſo blind, from the time of the firſt entrance into him. S. <hi>Remigius</hi> praied for him, and the foule fiend depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the man recouered his ſight, and was free from all euill, for which cauſe he gaue vnto God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite thanks.</p>
               <p>Another time the good Bishop being in the city of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> lodged in the houſe of the Church of S. <hi>Nicaſius</hi> martir, ſometime B. of that city, there befell a great fier, which burned a great part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Notice herof came to S. <hi>Remigius,</hi> who firſt praied, and then went unto the place, where the fire was raging and burning with ſuch fury, that all thought it would haue conſumed the wholl citty. The Bleſſed man made the ſigne of the Croſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fire, which approched toward him, and it
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:181136:90"/>fled from him, and he followed it ſo long, vntill it came to be like a great boule, &amp; drew back to one of the gates of the city, and iſſued out of the ſame, to the great amazement of all the beholders. In the Church of S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> in the ſame city, he caſt a deuill out of a damoſell, which at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did ſo afflict her, that he left her for dead: S. <hi>Remigius</hi> made his oraiſons for her, &amp; reſtored her vnto life.</p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Fraunce</hi> had ſuffered many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by diuers tirants that made warre vpon it: one of them was <hi>Clodoueus</hi> ſonne to <hi>Childericus,</hi> who was poſſeſſed of the greateſt and beſt part of that Realme. This <hi>Clodoueus</hi> was a Painim Idollater, but had to his wife <hi>Clotidis</hi> a holy vertuous Chriſtian woman, of the houſe of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Shee had many times perſuaded the king to be Baptiſed, and to be come a Chriſtian, and he excuſed himſelf, alleaging that the ſouldiers of his army would kill him, if he did ſo.</p>
               <p>On a time being in warre againſt the <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Sueuians,</hi> and fighting with them, he fell into great danger, not only to be diſcomfited, but alſo to be ſlaine in the field. <hi>Clodoueus</hi> had in his company a Chriſtian, the duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who aduiſed the king to make a vowe vnto God, to be made a Chriſtian, aſſuring him thereby the victory ouer his foes. <hi>Clodoueus</hi> made the vowe, &amp; euery thing ſucceeded according to his deſire; for he not only was victorius in that encounter, but he alſo made that prouince ſubiect vnto his crowne.</p>
               <p>Then he returned with victory vnto <hi>Paris,</hi> his place of reſidence, and made relation vnto the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:181136:91"/>queen <hi>Clotildis</hi> of the vowe he had made, who being ioifull of it, ſent meſſengers for S. <hi>Remigius</hi> to come and confer with the king. The holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop came and ſpake with the king, and shewed to him ſuch pregnant reaſons, that he was fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be Baptiſed. The thing that ſtaied him was the fear, that his ſubiects would rebell againſt him. To put that doubt out of the kings mind, S. <hi>Remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> talked priuatly with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he principall men of the kings hoſt, and ſome times he preached to them in publik. Theſe priuate and publik ſpeeches of. S. <hi>Remigius</hi> were of ſuch force, that all ſaid, they would be Baptiſed, if the king was.</p>
               <p>The day wherin the king should be Baptiſed, was apointed: and much people were aſſembled; and all the chiefe men were in the Church, where the bleſſed Sacrament was to be celebrated. The king being vpon the fonte, the prieſts (by Gods permiſſion) had forgot to bring thither the holy oile, and when the king should haue bene anioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there with, S. <hi>Remigius</hi> perceaued the want therof. The throng of the people was ſo great, that it was impoſſible to haue it brought ſo ſoon as was fit: ſo that the holy ſaint was much perplexed, but he had in his hart recourſe vnto the father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, beſeeching him to help him in this neceſſity, leſt ther should ariſe any offence among the people: and behold, a Doue, carrieng in her bill a violl with holy oile therin, was ſeene euidently to come, and put it into the hands of S. <hi>Remigius,</hi> and then to fly away againe. The holy ſainct, after he had giuen thanks vnto God for this fauor receiued, anointed the king with that oile, after the accuſtomed vſage.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:181136:91"/>The ſweet odour of that oile was ſo great, that the king and others, who had ſeene the miracle, were aſtonied therat, and rendered vnto God infinit thanks for the ſame. <hi>Clodoueus</hi> was then named <hi>Lodouicus,</hi> and vnto S. <hi>Remigius</hi> aſwell the king, as the other noblemen that were Baptiſed that day, shewed many fauors, and gaue him many poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other reuenews; which he diſtributed among the Churches of his Dioceſſ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Remigius</hi> in his old age knew by reuelation from heauen, that there would enſue a great dearth and ſcarcety of corne in all <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and therefore he, like another <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> gathered good ſtore therof againſt that time of neceſſity, and heaped, and ſtaked it vp in a village called <hi>Celtum.</hi> This being done, certein countrie clownes vpon a feſtiuall day (hauing litle to do) talked together of the great ſtore of graine he had collected: And one of them ſaid: This Lazie old man (for ſo they called him for his great age) will I think, by his ingroſſing, become a merchant of corne. Another inſtigated by the deuill ſaid; let vs ſet it on fier &amp; burne it, and ſo he shall not gaine by his merchandize: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſſented; and ſo in an inſtant they ſett fire to the ſtacks, and burned much. As it happened, S. <hi>Remigius</hi> was not farre of, and being told of this accident, he ſpeedilie got to his horſe, and went to ſee if he could remedy it, but when he came, he found it paſt recouery. It was in a cold euening in the winter, which alſo was a vexation to the holy man, by reaſon of his age, and ſo he alighted from his nagge, and came neere to the fire to warme himſelf, with out any alteration of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:181136:92"/>and ſaid, God will not forget to punish him that hath done this euill, &amp; loſſe vnto poore men. and ſo it came to paſſe; for the peſants that ſet fier to the corne, became crook backt, and al their children that came of them were ſo alſo: The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that wrote this life ſaith he hath ſene ſome of their race, crook backt.</p>
               <p>To end; the time long deſired by S. <hi>Remigius,</hi> the day of his death aproached, by which he hoped to haue the rewarde of his trauell, tollerated for the loue of his Church, in gouerning the ſame, by the ſpace of 74 years; for ſo long he had bin Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. In all which time, he neuer did thing, that was not fit or conuenient, neither did he omitt to do that, which he ought to do.

               <p>He was firſt buried in a Church of S. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> in the ſame city of <hi>Rheimes:</hi> but bicauſe the Church was litle, and the concourſe of people, which came to viſite his ſepulcher, great; it was made bigger and larger, and of more curious and coſtly workmanship: in eſpeciall there was made a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:181136:92"/>moſt beautifull ſepulcher, for the body of the holy ſainct. but when they would haue caried it thither, they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it ſo weighty &amp; ſo heauy, that no humain force and ſtrength was able to moue it, in ſuch ſort, that all the clergy and people which were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to make that tranſlation, were penſiue and ſorowfull; yet ſtaied in the Church, ſinging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſpirituall ſongs.

I haue taken the life of this bleſſed Saint out of the writings of</hi> S. Bonauenture, S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus <hi>of</hi> Florence <hi>and others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Frauncis</hi> was borne at <hi>Aſſiſium,</hi> a city in the valley of <hi>Spoleto</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1182 and his father was a marchaunt called <hi>Peter Bernardo.</hi> At his Chriſtning he was named <hi>Iohn;</hi> which name was after at his Confirmation chaunged into <hi>Francis,</hi> for ſo was the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his father. He was brought vp well, and had good education, as being the eldeſt ſonne of his father; who ſet him to learne both La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and French, intending to make him his factoure in marchandiſe; whereunto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many languages was, as he knew well, verie neceſſary.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Frauncis</hi> being come to years of diſcretion began to help his father in his trafficque, aſwell within, as without the cittie. And for that, by this meanes, he was as chiefe maſter, and much money was returned thorough his hands (a thing moſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:181136:94"/>perillous, and pernitious for yong men) he ſpent verie prodigally in what he liked. This wrought many yong men of his years, and of euil behauior into his company; whoe moued him to liue, as they did, drowned in laſciuiouſnes, in ryot, and youthfull vanities Thus he gaue himſelf wholly to delights, to feaſtings, and vaine company; and yet alwaies in this euill behauioure he shewed ſome tokens of what he should then, and what he woud be after ward. On the one ſide, he omitted not to commit all ſinnes, with out any feare: yett on the other ſide, he did ſome good deeds; as giuing of almoſe in liberall ſort: for naturally he was very compaſſionat to the poore.</p>
               <p>One day it fell out, that a poore man asked an almoſe of him; and he becauſe he was verie buſy, gaue him none. The poore man departed: &amp; aſſoone as <hi>Francys</hi> perceued it, he reproued himſelf; and ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning after him found him out, and not only gaue him almoſe, but alſo very lowely craued pardon of him; and forthwith he alſo made a vowe, that from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceforth, he neuer would deny to giue any thing, that was demaunded of him for Gods ſake, if it lay in his power. And perſeuering in the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo worthy a vowe, euen vntill his death, he receaued manie eſpecial great fauours of God: one was, that as often, as euer he heard theſe words for Gods ſake; ſo often he felt a great tendernes of hart, the cauſe of great conſolation.</p>
               <p>In regard of the Almoſe, and other good deeds <hi>S. Frauncis</hi> did, God ſent him many good inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſerued as meanes to pull him out of that euill courſe of life, in which he liued. One of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:181136:94"/>theſe meanes and motions was a whole yeares im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſſonment in the city of <hi>Perugia,</hi> among other citiſens of <hi>Aſſiſiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> cauſed by a controuerſie between theſe two cities. <hi>Francis</hi> in this priſon shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a man of great courage in aduerſity, as being always mery; and comforting other his fellow priſoners, that were penſiue and ſad. Peace was concluded between theſe citties; the priſoners were diſcharged; and <hi>Francis</hi> fell againe to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſes; prodigally ſpending his fathers goods among his companions, in feaſting, gaming, and carnallity: and this life he led vntill he was 25. years old.</p>
               <p>Comming to that age, God did call him againe by a long and grieuous infirmitie, the booke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man learnes manie good leſſons. Firſt he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a liuelie and feeling knowledge of this tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he is mortall; and that his health is not of himſelfe. He learneth moreouer to know his ſinnes, ſeing that ſicknes is often times cauſed by them. He learneth allſo to feare hell fire as more neerely threatning deſerued punishment; which feare doth more earneſtly ſtirre him vp, to deſire and thirſt after eternall ioyes. He learneth to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe all worldly riches, as things that cannot reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re him to health. He lerneth to prepare himſelfe to dye, ſeinge infirmitie the harbinger of death in his lodginge. He learneth to feare the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, making this diſcourſe: if in time of Mercie he chaſtizeth and ſcourgeth vs thus ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, what will he doe in the time of Iuſtice. All theſe things S. <hi>Frauncis</hi> did learne by that ſickneſſe wherewith God did viſit him. Where fore being
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:181136:95"/>reſtored againe to health, he aroſe from his bed with great feruoure, and purpoſe to profit in the way of oure Lord. Forthwith an occaſion was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him: for a poore man in euill ſtate &amp; ragged cloathes asked him an almes, as he was going out of doores. S. <hi>Frauncis</hi> looking on him, knew him well; for he was a gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fallen to decay: &amp; ſuch compaſſion came into his mind, regarding him as if JESVS CHRIST were in the likenes of that poore man, that turning aſide, he pulled his new garment of his back, &amp; coped with the poore man his ragged clothes. The night enſuing, as <hi>Francis</hi> ſlept, he thought he was in a faire roome, where in lay many rich pearles and Iewells of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable price; there he alſo did ſee our Lord IESVS CHRIST, for whoſe ſake he had giuen the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the poore man; and he hard him ſay: I keep theſe rich Iewells for my ſouldiers, who take vp my Croſſe on their shoulders, and followe me. S. <hi>Francis</hi> aroſe with an ardent deſire to gett part of thoſe riches; and ſtudied (as he went) howe he might obtaine them. Then thought he, perhapps it is the will of God, I should be a ſouldier in the warre againſt the Infidells, in the holy land; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Chriſtians did were a Croſſe on their armor, to gaine the Indulgences giuen by the Pope to them, that took the Croſſe. S. <hi>Frauncis</hi> therfore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to haue taken that Croſſe; and to that end bought him horſe and Armour: but it was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto him from Heauen, that Gods holie will was, he should be a ſouldier in an other manner. This cauſed <hi>S. Francis</hi> to be very carefull, to know what was the will of God.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:181136:95"/>
               <p>Sometines he would go into ſecret places, and there pray and shed ſo many tears, that his eyes did verily ſeeme two fontaines. thoſe teares proceeded from the remembrance of his life paſt, &amp; of the leud ſpending of his time. He oftentimes ſaid: Ah wretched ſinner that I am? how hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous an offender am I? Oh what an euill reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning can I yeld to God of the flower of my years? howe blind was I, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſo many ſinnes againſt my God, who is ſo gracyous, ſo mighty, and who hath shewed me ſo many fauours and benefits? I am now handled euen as I deſerue: at this preſent he is deaff to me, and will not declare in what ſort his pleaſure is, I ſerue him; for that I haue bene deaff to him, who gaue me ſo many good inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus he praied inceſſantly, deſiring God to diſcloſe and declare his will vnto him, and what he should do the better to ſerue him.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Francis</hi> doing thus; one day he came into the Church of S. <hi>Damyan,</hi> neere to the city of <hi>Aſſiſiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and kneeling before the Roode, inſtantly deſired IESVS CHRIST, to deliuer him from this anxiety and doubt, and alſo to declare his will vnto him and with that he heard a voyce ſay vnto him: <hi>Frauncis, Repair my Church which is ready to fall.</hi> He was ſomewhat afraid, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard the voice, but was forth with comforted; imagining, that God did bid him repaire that Church, wherin he praied. Wherupon he diligently went to put it in effect; and getting good ſtore of merchaundiſe together, and hauing ſold them, he brought the mony, and gaue it vnto the prieſt of the Church; but the prieſt would not take it, for feare of S.

                  <hi>Francis</hi> his father, who, (as he knew right well) would ſtorme and chafe therat. S. <hi>Francis</hi> ſeing the prieſt refuſe the mony, put it all in a purſe, and threwe it to him, and told him, what he should do therewith. The father fo S. <hi>Francis</hi> hearing that his ſonne ſold his wares for ready money, vnder theire value and the true worth, and imagining what the matter was, went to ſeek him with a heauy hart: &amp; hearing he was gone to the Church of S. <hi>Damian,</hi> thither he went to follow and find him. S. <hi>Francis</hi> ſawe him comming a farre of, and to auoid his fury, hid himſelf in a vault. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a rage came to the Church, and not finding his ſonne there, began to quarell with the prieſt, who being afrighted with his threats, ſaid to him: your ſonne was heere, and would haue giuen me this mony, and I would not take it; wherupon he threw it on the ground, &amp; went away ſaying: that I should repair ther with this Church, that needed repaire. His father tooke the mony and ſaid; the mony is myne. and his choler now being ſome what alayed, he returned home, longing to find his ſonne, that he might giue him ſome reproach full punishment, for that he vſed in this manner, to ſpend his goods.</p>

                  </note> but purſued him, when
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:181136:96"/>he departed. So doth the deuill alſo, for when one flyeth from him, he purſueth him with a 1000. tentations. So did the father of S. <hi>Francis</hi> alſo, for as long, as he gaue himſelf to a lewd and wicked life, he neuer examined nor reprooued him; but when he was deſirous and began to be vertuous, and to be good, he purſued him euen almoſt to death. S. <hi>Francis</hi> lay cloſe in the vault many daies, continually and deuoutly and with teares praieng vnto God, to let him knowe his will. At laſt he came out of the vault and went into the city, with a firme reſolution, patiently to ſuffer all that might happen. Aſſoone as the people ſawe him altred, pale, and leane, and going dully, as if he had bene out of his witts, in ragged and torne clothes; they cried after him in the ſtreet, as if he had bene a foole. His father, being told of him, came out of his houſe into the ſtreet like a lyon, and led him away, reuiling, and miſnaming him. He kept him in a houſe very hardly, and to disburden his furyous rage the more vpon him, he lockt him vp in a roome, and bound him to a poſt. Theſe things S. <hi>Francis</hi> abode and endured patiently.</p>
               <p>After certin dayes, his father had occaſion to ryde out of towne vpon ſome buſines; wherupon his mother a good Chriſtian, and pitifull, hauing compaſſion on her ſonne, and fearing her husband would do ſome futher outrage, went to Francis, &amp; weeping as shee ſatte by him, shee deſired him to shewe a will to ſerue God, to for ſake the world, not to ſpend his fathers goods lewdly, to his great and iuſt diſpleaſure, and not to behaue himſelf ſo as to be accounted a foole, wherby he was a shame
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:181136:97"/>&amp; reproach to all his kindred. Hauing put this into his head, shee vnlooſed his bandes, and ſet him at liberty, and away went he from his fathers houſe; who shortly after coming home, &amp; finding <hi>Francis</hi> gone, was wrothe therat, and went to ſeek him. At laſt he found him, and to end all controuerſies between them they agreed, to go before the Bishop of <hi>Aſſiſium</hi> &amp; that there <hi>Francis</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his right and heritage due to him; and that his other brethen should haue it among them, leſt he should ſpend it prodigally. S. <hi>Francis,</hi> the true &amp; perfect louer of pouerty, was content here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and when they came before the Bishop, he not only fulfilled his fathers requeſt, but alſo ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped himſelf of all his clothes euen to his shirt, and gaue them to his father, ſayeng: vntill this time, I haue called thee father, but from henſceforth, I will acknowledge no other father, but oure father in heauen. The Bishop ſeeing this feruent act, and wondering therat, ſtood vp, and embraced him, weeping for tendernes, couered him with his cloake, and commaunded his ſeruants to bring him ſome cloths to put on. They brought him a verie poore and courſe ſuite, and the holy man receued it cheerfully.</p>
               <p>Taking leaue and bleſſing of the Bishop, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Aſſiſium,</hi> and went to a hoſpitall of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and there remained certaine daies, attending on the ſick, very charitably. He washed their ſores, he clenſed their filth, and did eate that meat which they did leaue. This mortification of the holy man was great; for before his conuerſion it was death for him to ſee a leper: yea, he would ſtoppe his noſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:181136:97"/>and be ready to vomit: but when he began a new life, he was of a contrary mind; for if he ſawe a leaper he thought he ſawe and Angell, and his ſoares ſeemed to be pretious ſtones. In the time of this exerciſe, he vſed vnceſſant praier. One day the B. man being at his praiers, he heard a voice, which ſaid to him: FRANCIS: <hi>Change ſweet into ſower, and deſpiſe thy ſelf, yf thou wilt pleaſe me.</hi> The holy man iudged by this voice, that God required of him ſome further ſeruice, then to ſtay in that hoſpitall: wherfore he departed, entending to go vnto <hi>Gubbio.</hi> As he went by the way, ſinging in the Frenche toung, thieues mett &amp; asked him, who he was? he aunſwered: <hi>I am trompetter to the great king:</hi> The thieues beign wroth at this his aunſwer, and ſeing they could make no booty of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meanely arraied, they buffetted &amp; kicked him; and then threw him into a ditch full of ſnowe. Poore <hi>Francis</hi> got out of the ditch, and the ſnowe, with much a do; but iocond he was and began a fresh to ſing ſpirituall ſongs.</p>
               <p>When he came to <hi>Gubbio,</hi> an old friend who knew him, and wondered to ſee him in that weede, led him home, and gaue him very good cloths of his owne to weare. The ſtudy and care of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God was, how he might beſt pleaſe almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtie God: wherfore vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, how the relligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men of S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> order liued in pouerty, obedience, chaſtity, and holy life; he had a deſire to try if that manner of liuing liked him, wherfore he went to one of their monaſteries, and deſired them to receue him into their houſe Thoſe relligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men receued him, and gaue him (as <hi>Antoninus,</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:181136:98"/>and <hi>Sabellicus</hi> ſay) a habite of black ſay, and a lether girdle; which he wore but a while, neither did he perſeuere in this auncient order, for that God had apointed <hi>Frauncis</hi> to inſtitute a new relligious order.</p>
               <p>One day, being in in the Church, and hearing in the Ghoſpell, that IESVS CHRIST ſent his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to preach, and commaunded them, to cary neither gold nor ſiluer, nor any thing to eate, nor ſtaf, nor shoos, nor two garments with them; he felt in his hart a ſodaine and vnwonted ioy, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe words were ſpoken to him: and that all which he had ſearched to know, (to wit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n what courſe he might ſerue God beſt) was in theſe words declared vnto him; &amp; that he muſt expect no other aunſwer. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit was ſo imprinted in the mind of <hi>Francis,</hi> that he thought it no time to ſtay any logner; but forthwith he put of his black habite of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and left of alſo the leather girdle, and put about him a poore and bare gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of courſe cloth, &amp; guirded himſelf with a cord. He pluckt of his shoos, and went barefoot: and thus hauing property in nothing, he began to lead a true penitent, and Apoſtolicall life.</p>
               <p>He went from place to place, from one city to another, and preached euery where, as God inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, his words were lowely, ſimple, and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are, yet ſo efficatious, that many which hard him, were moued to compunction, and amended their lifes; and ſome deſpiſing wholie the world, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed themſelues in ſack cloth, or other courſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, as S. <hi>Francis,</hi> did; and went and followed him. So that he had II. diſciples, of which ſome
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:181136:98"/>were well ſtudied in diuinity and humanity; all which deſired to ſerue God. The bleſſed man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them all with his mind, which was to go and preach penannce in diuers places, diuiding themſelues, and ſo they did.</p>
               <p>After a while they mett againe all, at the place where <hi>S. Francis</hi> was, euery one giuing account of what he had done. And beholding the great profit of ſoules ariſing thereby, he had a greater deſire to continew this exercize, in regard the verie ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men ragged &amp; barefoot, with ſuch palefaces together with the conſideraton of their profound humility, &amp; renouncing all property to any thing, (yea although they should not ſpeake) was a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Penannce, and did much good. But when they adioined words agreable therunto, the more plaine and the more ſimple they were, the more did they kindle the loue of God, and were imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the harts of the people to their great good.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Francis</hi> conſidering well all this, to the end that the inſtitution might haue a firme foundation, and go well forward, and encreaſe he thought it meet to acquaint the Apoſtolik ſea there with, and to deſire the Pope to confirme it, for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he, and his diſciples went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and caryed the Rule with them in writing, to be showen vnto the Pope <hi>Inocent.</hi> 3. There aroſe ſome difficultie, when they treated of the obſeruation of the Rule: for the Pope &amp; many Cardinalls were of opinion, that no newe relligious order should be inſtituted and that if any had an intention to ſerue God in relligion, he might enter into ſome relligious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alredy approued, as into the order of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:181136:99"/>or S. <hi>Benedict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It came to paſſe, that the Pope went to bed, toiled with affaires of the Church: and falling a ſleep, dreamed that the Church of <hi>S. Iohn Lateran</hi> was ready to fall, and that he ſawe a poore, bare, and abiect man vnder propping it with his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſuſteining, and keeping it from falling. Aſſoone as the Pope did behold S. <hi>Francis,</hi> he knew ſtraight that he was that poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who vpheld the Church of S. <hi>Iohn Lateran</hi> with his shoulders. And conſidering the purity and ſincerity of his hart, howe he deſpiſed the world, and loued pouerty; his conſtancy in this purpoſe of following that Euangelicall life written in his Rule, according to which he deſired to liue; and regarding alſo his great zeale for the ſaluation of ſoules, his feruent deſire to imitate IESVS CHRIST, he ſaid: without doubt this ſame is the man I ſawe in my ſleep, &amp; I ſuppoſe that this man with his good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of life and doctrine, will help to ſuſteine and vphold the Church of God; and with all he graunted vnto S. <hi>Francis</hi> his requeſt and deſire, and confirmed his Rule, <hi>Viuae vocis oraculo</hi> viz: by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>Then the holy man made a ſolemne profeſſion in the hands of the Pope, &amp; ſo did all his company, promiſing to liue after that Euangelicall Rule. when this was done, the Pope ordeinted S. <hi>Francis</hi> Generall of all the order. Theſe things happened in the year of our Lord 1209. But becauſe there was no Bull made therof at this time, therefore the confirmation of this order of Friers Minors is not accounted but from the time of <hi>Honorius</hi> the Pope,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:181136:99"/>who 15. years after this, confirmed the ſame by a particuler <hi>Bull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and other Popes ſince haue confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and illuſtrated the ſame, with ſpeciall graces, and priuiledges.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Francis</hi> returned to <hi>Aſſiſium,</hi> and with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren withdrew him ſelfe into a litle houſe n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere to the city, and there continued in praier and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. From this houſe, they went to a litle Church or chappell belonging to the Benedictine monks, who beſtowed it freely vpon S. <hi>Francis.</hi> This chappell was called S. <hi>Maria de Angelis,</hi> or by another name, S. <hi>Maria de Portiuncula.</hi> This was the firſt houſe, or formed monaſtery of al the order The firſt time S. <hi>Francis</hi> came thither, he ſeemed to be very ioifull, and ſaid to his Friers: that this place should be the head of all his order.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Francis</hi> then departed from thence, and ſo did all his brethren: and went preaching, not only in the city of <hi>Aſſiſium,</hi> neere vnto them, but alſo in other places; eſpecially the Seraphicall father beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming an Euangelicall tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet, paſſed thorough cities, caſtles and townes, preaching the word of God, not with eloquent words, or worldly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome, but with feruour and power and ſpirit of the liuing God. The people, who ſawe and heard him ſpeak, thought him to be a man of a higher and another world: for his hart and viſage was euer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rected toward heauen, and he laboured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect euerie one in his company, to think of the world to come. many were conuerted by his wordes, and many did keepe him company: who for the deſire they had to imitate IESVS CHRIST, followed the footſteps of the holy ſaint, whom
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:181136:100"/>they took for their guide, deſpiſing all kind of worldly goods, and embracing holy pouerty.</p>
               <p>It would be tedious to recount all the things this holy father did, as his godly exerciſes, and the holy life he led, when he began to found his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lligious order: Firſt, he was moſt abſtinent in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking: his ordinary diet was bread and water, with ſome pulſe, and ſodden herbs: If at any time he was forced by ſicknes to eat flesh, when he was recouered, he would for a requitall, repaire the abſtinence broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with double auſterity on his body. He ſo diuided the yeare into lents, that he faſted almoſt all of it, eating but only once a day. His firſt lent began at thend of twelftyde vntill <hi>Eaſter:</hi> Another he kept after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Holy Ghoſt. Another for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> Another againſt the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lady; and when that feaſt was gone, he faſted tille the feaſt of S. <hi>Michaell</hi> tharchangell and then at the bleſſed feaſt of <hi>All Saints,</hi> he began his <hi>Aduent</hi> vntill <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> The bare earth was the ordinary bed for his weak and feeble body; and for a pillowe he laid a ſtone vnder his head. He ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pt very litle, but watched almoſt all night in praier. His apparaill was one gowne with a hood, and a rope was his girdle: he went ſome times vnto the deſert places and mountains, to pray the more quietly.</p>
               <p>It happened on a time, that S. <hi>Francis</hi> being in the night in the deſert <hi>Sacianum</hi> in a litle caue, the deuill called him by his name, and the bleſſed man anſwered him, not knowing who it was, that called him. The fiend ſaid to him: There is not ſo great a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:181136:100"/>ſinner in the world, but God will pardon him, if he be conuerted but they that will shorten their daies with rigorous penances shall find no mercy, before the heauenly maieſty. The ſeruant of God hearing theſe words was aſtonied; and ſtudied, whither he did well or no, in doing ſuch and ſo auſtere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But that he might know who it was that talked with him (by the permiſſion of our good God) he was ſurpriſed with a greuous temptation of carnallity: aſſoone as he perceaued it, he threw of his cloths, and gaue him ſelf a very ſore diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: and bicauſe it did not repell the aſſault, he haſted out of the caue, naked as he was; and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vp and downe in the ſnowe, of which there was much in that deſert. When he had ſo done, he made ſeuen heapes of ſnow in a round compaſſe; and coming into the middeſt of them, ſaid to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Thou my body; yonder great one, thou ſeeſt, is thy wife; theſe four be thy children, two boies, and two girles; the other two be thy ſeruants: nowe thou muſt take paines to maintein them, and prouide cloths for them all, leaſt they dye for cold. But if thou thinkeſt it chargeable, endeuor thy ſelf to liue chaſt, and to ſerue God only, which is a great deale better, and more eaſye. In this ſort the holy ſaint ouer came the tentation, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill with shame departed away. The glorious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduiſed his friers to be abſtinent, and to auoid Idlenes, if they would be freed from ſuch tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The great loue <hi>S. Francis</hi> bare to CHRIST may be knowen by this, that there was neuer any ſo much deſired to liue, as he did to dye, for CHRIST
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:181136:101"/>his ſake. this moued him to go into <hi>Siria,</hi> among the Infidells, that he might obtein the crowne of martirdome: but he returned, for that he could not obtaine his deſire. Alſo the glorious father bare great loue vnto his neighbour, helping euery one in their neceſſities, aſwell of the body, as of the ſoule. It was his ordinary vſage, if he ſawe any poore man with ragged clothes, to exchange with him; he vſed to all of them great reſpect and reuerence: for he thought, he ſawe CHRIST in euery one of them. The wonderfull miracles he did worke, as caſting out of deuills, healing of the ſick, and raiſing of the dead, be ſo many, that, only of them, a iuſt volume might be made. many of them are mencioned in the Bull of his Canoniſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a ſufficient proofe, that they be of good credit and Authenticall.</p>
               <p>Such being his life and deeds; not only men, and they which embraced his Rule imitated him, but alſo women; as S. <hi>Clara</hi> a maide of a worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full family in <hi>Aſsiſium;</hi> who went to the conuent of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> accompanied with the people of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe (although shee had not ſaid any thing to them, of her intention) and the glorious father S. <hi>Francis</hi> receaued her, and gaue vnto her a Rule wherby to liue in a monaſtery. And within few daies many other well diſpoſed damoſells came to her, who all liued vnder the Rule, that S. <hi>Francis</hi> gaue her, which is called <hi>the order of S. Clara.</hi> So that this bleſſed father hauing alſo founded ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order, there were three Rules ordeined by him, all which were confirmed by the popes.</p>
               <p>The firſt was of the friers minors, whoſe end is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:181136:101"/>to exerciſe themſelues in contemplations; and in the actiue life, by the exerciſe of preaching. The ſecond Rule was of Nonnes of the order of <hi>S. Clara</hi> who be of two ſorts; ſome haue reuenews and lands, and liue in common: Some other haue no reuenews, and theſe are called of the firſt Rule, and liue of almoſe. The third is of the Penitents, which are called of the third Rule: and theſe alſo be of two ſorts; ſome haue reuenews, and liue in colledges, and in common; and theſe be properly called relligious perſons, and the vowe they make is ſolemne, be they men or women. The women of this Rule do differ from the Nonnes of S. <hi>Clara,</hi> in this; that they were no veiles, and be not bound but only to the obſeruance of the three eſſentiall vowes, vnder paine of mortall ſinne, as <hi>Pope Leo</hi> 10. declared. The other of this third Rule liue in their owne houſe, and haue reuenews, and their vowe is not ſollemne, and theſe by conſequence are not properly relligious perſons, but perſons of honeſt behauiour, and are called vſually in <hi>Italy Pizzo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:181136:102"/>preach vnto his moores. but for that he gathered no fruit in that country, he returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Honorius</hi> 3. was pope after <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> 3. in the year of our Lord 1216. There he found the glorious father S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who came too haue his Rule and order confirmed.</p>
               <p>Whileſt S. <hi>Dominick</hi> treated therof, he had one night a reuelation, in the which IESVS CHRIST diſpleaſed for the many ſinnes of the world, ſeemed to be redy to ruinate &amp; deſtroy it: Then ſawe he our bleſſed lady to kneele before him, and intreate him to ſpare it. And to moue him to mercy, shee preſented vnto him the ſame S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and <hi>S.

               <p>This B. father being in <hi>Rome</hi> was preſented to the pope <hi>Honorius</hi> 3. and talked with him of many things. And the pope, with the conſent of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls confirmed his Rule, and they all receaued ſperituall ioy, in hearing his diuine diſcourſes.

If God had shewed ſuch fauors and mercies vnto any man, as he hath to me; how wicked and lewd ſo euer he had bin, he would haue rendered greater thanks, and haue kept his commaundements better then I haue done.

               <p>Sometimes one that is vitious, or one that is good, is bidden to imitate God, and if perhapps he thinketh, he can not do it, God giueth him a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne or a modell, which he may imitate, when he will. S. <hi>Francis</hi> preached the deſpiſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, and it ſeemeth that many men did not giue credit vnto him.

               <p>S. <hi>Francis</hi> is like the keeper of the common ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of meaſure, vnto which all the other keepers of meaſure reſort.

The courtiers, that be fauored of the king, are apparailled in his liuery; and becauſe S. Francis was highly fauored of IESVS CHRIST he was therfore cloathed in the liuery of his wounds. <hi>Iacob</hi> wraſtled with God, and remained lame: S. <hi>Francis</hi> wraſtled with God, and he was made lame alſo, for the wounds of his feet ſuffered him not to trauell, but he was compelled to ride on a litle Aſſe.</p>

               <p>Forthwith he ſett the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to building of it, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it dilligently and carefully; and in that ſpace he reſtored his ſight to one, that had bin blind. 18. yeres: and caſt out the deuill from an other, wherby the fame of him was ſpred ouer all the I<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>s'land &amp; it paſſed ouer into <hi>Africa,</hi> ſo that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe coſts, ſick men were brought to be healed by him, and by his praiers they were cured.</p>
               <p>For theſe deeds <hi>Placidus</hi> was extolled vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the mouthes of euery one; and the more he was praiſed and exalted, the more he humbled and meeked him ſelf. He was mercifull, good, and gracious vnto all; he was euen conſolation it ſelf vnto all thoſe that were in diſtreſſe; comfort to the afflicted, health to the diſeaſed; helpe and releif to the needy; a father to the poore; and a teacher to the rich; he did good to euerie one, and all receaued benefit at his hand. He had often confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and communication with the bailies and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:181136:111"/>ouerſeers of his fathers land and poſeſſions, that were informer times, though now belonging to his order, about diuers things, and left them all well pleaſed; and willed them to adminiſter that, which euery one had vnder his charge, with all fidelity; that making to them ſelfs ſome reaſonable gaine, his religious order might ſuſteine no damage, nor haue anie euill report ſpread of it.</p>
               <p>In the fourth yeare after he came into <hi>Sycilia,</hi> the building of the monaſterie, with the Church of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Euangeliſt (which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated by the B. of <hi>Meſſina</hi>) was finished. <hi>Placidus</hi> with his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons led a life of great example; whereby manie were moued to abbandon the world, and came vnto him: ſo that, in a short ſpace, there was thirty of them. The life of <hi>Placidus</hi> was wonderfull: his words ſauoured of celeſtiall feruour, with which he comforted, and taught them to deſpize and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the world, to hate Lordships, dignities, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghts and noyſome pleaſures, that they might more freely ſerue IESVS CHRIST: to which end he alleaged manie reaſons full of autority, &amp; modeſty. part of the day he ſpent in praier and mediation, wherin it was ſtrange to ſee how manie teares he shed; to heare the ſobbes which came from his breſt as he lifted vp his ſpirite to God. In lent he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the ſonday, the tueſay, and thurſday, with bread and water only: the other dayes he eate not any thing; and in all the yeare he drank no wine; and beſides he wore a haire cloth next his skinne. When he was ouer wearied with praying and kneeling, he ſlept a litle, rather ſitting then lyeng. For any accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that befell, he was neuer angry; but

He neuer ſpake but vpon conſtraint or neceſſity; to giue the monks or the poore conſolation, or els for affaires belonging to the monaſtery: and, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his affaires, he had alwaies his ſpirit eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God. When it was made knowen once in <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Placidus</hi> was in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and that he had made there a monaſtery, in the whith were already 30. monks; what a bleſſed life he led, what great miracles God shewed by him; <hi>Eutichius</hi> and <hi>Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his brother, and <hi>Flauia</hi> his ſiſter, deſirous to ſee him, hauing obtained leaue of their father, paſſed by ſea into <hi>Sicilia.</hi> being diſembarqued, they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the monaſtery of S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> where they ſawe <hi>Placidus</hi> their brother, but knewe him not; either for the long time he had bin abſent, S. <hi>Benedict</hi> receauing him at the age of 7 yeares; or els for that he was ſo leane and diffigured, through his exceding abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.

               <p>The tirant on the one ſide, and the executioners on the other ſide, moued them to deny CHRIST: but the holy men perſeuered in confeſſing him, whom they requſted to giue them ſtrength, to ſuſteine the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which hourely encreaſed, at the hands of the bloody butchers.

               <p>He went into Egypt to ſtudie the better, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the courſe of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the force &amp; influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſtarres, and all that knowledge of Aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologie. Being about the age of fiue and twentie, and reſiding in the cittie of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> in companie of one <hi>Appollophanes,</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> and a famous ſophiſter; he did behold that ſtrange Eclypſe, which happened at the death of oure Sauioure: when viewing the creator of al things, the author of lyfe, and fountaine of all light ſo darkned, ſoe ecclypſed, ſo ignominiouſly ſuffering death, the Sunne, as one ashamed to behold that ſpectacle, did hide, an whollie looſe his beames, in the midſt of the day. S. Dionyſe, as a man that was skillfull in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:181136:119"/>learning, did quicklie perceaue this Ecclypſe was againſt the courſe of nature, by reaſon it laſted aboue the naturall periode; but much more, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Moone was at the full, and whollie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the ſunne; ſo that, ſupernaturallie run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a violent courſe, she alltogether couered the ſunne, and keeping him ſo for the ſpace of three houres, returned againe to her former place of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. He wondered at ſo rare a miracle, that neither was heard nor ſeene before; and being amazed ſaid to Appollophanes and others: <hi>Either the God of nature doth ſuffer, or els the wholle frame of the world doth perish and is diſſolued.</hi> He noted the yeare the day and the houre in which this ſtrange noueltie and wonder ſuccceded, which was ſo dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelie imprinted in his minde, that he neuer forgot it all his life. He returned to <hi>Athens,</hi> and liued in his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth with great moderation, and reputation; the <hi>Athenienſes</hi> honouring him, as a moſt wiſe Philoſopher, and vprighte Iudge. They made him preſident or chiefe of the higheſt courte of Iuſtice, that was in all Athens. This courte was called of the <hi>Areopagites:</hi> who tooke theire name from a place, where the court was kepte: which was in a ſtreete or litle hill called in Greeke <hi>Pagus</hi> dedicated to <hi>Ares</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Mars:</hi> and the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this court were ſo graue &amp; vpright, that in ancient times to call a Iudge vnſpotted, ſeuere, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted, vnflexible either for loue, or feare, or flatterie or briberie, they would call him an <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagite.</hi> It came to paſſe, that about this time, S. <hi>Paule</hi> did preache the Ghoſpell in Athens. He diſputed ſundrie times with the <hi>Epicurean Pithagorean,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:181136:120"/>Academicall, Stoicall Peripateticall</hi> philoſphers, and laboured to reduce them to the faith of IESVS CHRIST, and draw them from theire Idolatrie. He told them of an other life; of reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bodies, of a generall Iudgement; of a ſupernaturall reward or punishment, according to eache mans good or bad works. Theſe Philoſophers hearing a matter of ſuch conſequence, and fearing the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of new religions, and thinking it a thinge of greateſt importance, brought him before the chiefe court of <hi>Areopagites,</hi> and theire ſupreme Iudge <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius.</hi> For allthough the Romaines were in actuall poſeſſion of the wholl world in a maner, and Lords of all <hi>Greece,</hi> yet the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens</hi> were permitted to liue in their auncient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty gouerned by theire owne Lawes, officers &amp; magiſtrats freely elected by themſelfs.</p>
               <p>When <hi>S. Paule</hi> was brought before <hi>Dionyſe</hi> &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magiſtrats, in the preſence of the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who had before giuen informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, he with a Retorique more diuine, then humain, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not to exaſperat ſo wiſe and learned a nation, by telling them he was come to teach them a thing wherin thy were ignorant, and to giue them notice of gods, that they knewe not of; all which they would hardly haue diſgeſted, or els taken in euill part, ſaid thus vnto them:</p>
               <p>You men of <hi>Athens,</hi> I haue ſene by experience, that you be a very ſuperſtitious people, more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to your gods, then the other Greeks: for you labour to haue more, &amp; honoure them more, then all the reſt as you haue more knowledg, and be more learned, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt. Now I walking through
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:181136:120"/>your city, and beholding the many temples which be therin, I ſawe one vpon whoſe altar, there was this Inſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>To the vnknowen god.</hi> That ſame God whom you doe honor vnknowen, is he whom I doe preach vnto you, and wish you to honor care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. He is not for from you, nor from any mortall man, ſince (as one of your owne poets ſaid very well) we liue in him, by him we moue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in him; of him we gaue oure being, oure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; lyfe. Then ſpeaking againſt the multiplicitie of God, he tould them at laſt of the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the reſurrection of the dead The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere they gaue him, was this: that they would giue him audience ſome other day, and ſo diſmiſſed him.</p>
               <p>These fewe words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> were ſo full of miſteryes, that they put all these wiſe &amp; lerned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſilence, yea and aſtonied and amaſed them The Apoſtle departed, but not empty handed: for he caught in his net the chief magiſtrat <hi>Dioniſe,</hi> with whom he had confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in priuate: and in the end, the Apoſtle gaue him prefect and full notice of our faith. He preached vnto him IESVS CHRIST God and man, his death, paſſion, reſurrection, and aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vnto heauen. And bycauſe the Apoſtle made particuler mention of the eclipſe which happened at the time of our <hi>Sauiours</hi> death, &amp; S. Dioniſe was deſirous to know that wonder, aſſone as it was laid open vnto him, he yielded forthwith and ſaid he would be a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>It might ſeeme a lightneſſ in <hi>S. Dioniſe,</hi> to giue creditt ſo ſoone vnto a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, in a matter of ſuche importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as it is to renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the gods ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:181136:121"/>by his forefathers, and to receue a newe God that was crucified: and the more, for that he was ſo lerned, and was therefore more obliged to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der very well thereof, before he altered his opinion in a matter of ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence. Vnto this I aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re by the ſame reaſon: S. <hi>Dioniſe,</hi> becauſe he was wiſe and learned, reſolued vpon an honorable and worthy matter ſo ſoone. For euen as he, and all other wiſemen of the Paynims were reprouable, to adore them for gods, whom thy knew had bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous wycked men, ſo they deſired to find ſome, that should giue them knowledge of another God, more worthy to be worshipped, then they were: They knew likewiſe by the light of nature, that there ought not to be many gods, but one God only. So that <hi>Dioniſe</hi> hauing this deſire, and S. <hi>Paule</hi> coming to incounter him, he fled not from the combat, but did rather (holpen by God) follow the Apoſtle, with out reſiſtaunce, and by Baptiſme was made a Chriſtian. There were others alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, but S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> did ſurpaſſe them all in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and holy works: for which cauſe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle made him prieſt and alſo Bishop of that city.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> was the firſt Bishop that <hi>Athens</hi> had, and that was great glory vnto the city, bycauſe it had brought vp, and giuen learnyng vnto her firſt paſtour. This holy ſaint had priuate frendship, and conuerſed a long time with the <hi>Deuine Hierotheus,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> borne, (after the opinion of many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.) who was inſtructed in like maner by S. <hi>Peter</hi> in deuine letters, and ther vpon he was called <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi> S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> confeſſeth that he was his inſtructor, and that of him he learned the knowledge of holy
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:181136:121"/>writ. This holy ſaint vnderſtanding that the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin was yet aliue in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> had a great deſire to ſee her; and ſo he went thither and ſawe her. <hi>Hubertinus</hi> recounteth of him that ſeeing the great brightnes of her face, her heauenly beauty her celeſtiall words, and the great company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells that attended vpon her, he ſaid of himſelf; that he had adored her for God, if by faith he had not knowen, there could be none, but only one God. The ſame S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> relateth, how he was preſent at her glorious paſſage out of this to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting lyfe, and reckoneth the names of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles there preſent alſo.</p>
               <p>He returned to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, exerciſing his office of paſtour, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting ſoules vnto God, vntill the laſt year of the raign of <hi>Nero,</hi> in the which he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee his maiſter <hi>S. Paul,</hi> at whoſe martirdome he was preſent, as he ſaith in an epiſtle of his to S. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothee,</hi> who was alſo the diſciple of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Then he returned vnto <hi>Athens;</hi> where he ſtaied vntill S. <hi>Clement</hi> the diſciple of S. <hi>Peter</hi> came to be Pope; who beholding in S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> good qualities, enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to go and preach the faith of CHRIST in <hi>Gallia,</hi> nowe called <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and adioined vnto him a prieſt called <hi>Ruſticus,</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> a deacon.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> thus accompanied went into <hi>Gallia,</hi> and came vnto <hi>Lutetia,</hi> now called <hi>Paris,</hi> which city he found to be great and rich, populous, and furnished abundantly, both from Heauen and earth: the climat very temperate, producing noble and haughty minds; the earth very fertill, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth all things neceſſary for the body. S. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:181136:122"/>reputed it euen another <hi>Athens,</hi> as Diuining it should be both in literature and ſtudy, ſuch as it after wards came to be. He reſolued to make his abode it that place, and began to open his heauenly breſt, and show the riches incloſed therin, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching the Goſpell. He added to his words many great miracles and wonders: as reſtoring theire ſight vnto the blind, hearing to the deafe, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che to the domb; curing many alſo of ſondry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infirmities. Wherfore in a short ſpace (ſuch was his fame) he grafted in that place moſt fertill plants and there made a garden, which brought forth quicklie abundaunce of fruit. He not only preached IESVS CHRIST in that city; but alſo bleſſed, and ſent his diſciples, to preach in ſondry coſts of the world. He ſent S. <hi>Eugenius</hi> the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>Toledo</hi> a great city of <hi>Spaine,</hi> into that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: where he preached the Ghoſpell, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many vnto the Chriſtian faith. Some others were ſent into <hi>Germany:</hi> who likewiſe gained many ſoules unto God yea, not only many men were conuerted, and made Chriſtians; but alſo the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Idolls were razed to the gorund: and moreouer, many Churches built; where the name of IESVS CHRIST was lauded and praiſed.</p>
               <p>This was a grat torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the deuill the deadly foe of mankind: wherfore he incenſed diuers to perſecute S. <hi>Dioniſe,</hi> imagining, that with takinge away his life, all this would fade and vanishe like ſmoake, and the adoration of Idolls would returne to its former eſtate and credit. So ſome of his miniſters, inſtigated by him, went to <hi>Rome,</hi> to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefy themperor <hi>Traian</hi> therof, as <hi>Suidas</hi> and other
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:181136:122"/>Authors affirme, though <hi>Metaphraſtes</hi> ſaith it was vnto <hi>Domitian,</hi> who in his deeds was a deuill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate. it may be theſe complaints were addreſſed vnto <hi>Domitian,</hi> and that he ment to ſend <hi>Feſſenius Siſinius</hi> the gouernor of that prouince, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d S. <hi>Dioniſe,</hi> or put him to death; and that <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> deceaſing in the meane ſpace, and the Senate reuoking, and repealing all the decrees of that bloudy tirant, the execution of this decree was ſtaied vntill the time of <hi>Traian,</hi> vnto whom new complaints of <hi>Dioniſe</hi> being come, he reuiued the decree made by <hi>Domitian,</hi> vpon which <hi>Feſſenius</hi> cauſed the B. Bishop to be apprehended. S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> was. 90. years of age, when he with <hi>Ruſticus</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> were taken.</p>
               <p>The gouernor diſcourſed a long time with them accuſing S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> very much for preaching of new gods, againſt the edict of themperour, and Senate of <hi>Rome;</hi> and for labouring to extinguish the adoration of the auncient Gods, ſo much renow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in the world; gods which had bin ſo fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Romain empire, as to extend and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their dominion ouer all the world. Haue compaſſion, ô <hi>Dioniſe,</hi> (ſaid the gouernor) of this they old age; And make ſome recompenſe for the harme thou haſt done. Confeſſe they errors, and recant thy opinions; which be vaine, and with out all foundation; perſuade the people to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don theſe new fangles, and returne to their former vſages. S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> hearing this, repleat with the zeale of Gods honor, anſwered; that he had perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many to leaue the adoration of the Gods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing it to be a vaine and foelish thing, to account
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:181136:123"/>thoſe for gods, who were vnworthy to be called men, their wickednes and infamy was ſuch, when they liued: that it was a great blindnes to adore ſtocks &amp; ſtones, &amp; pieces of wood; that what he had preached, was verie true, concerning IESVS CHRIST his being true God; and that neither fear, nor threats, nor torments should moue him, or ſtur his fellows from their faith.</p>
               <p>The gouernor was angrie at this aunſwer, and aroſe on a rage out of his chaire and ſaid: The Gods be deſpiſed, the Emperour diſobeied &amp; his ſubiects and people ſeduced by your forceries, in doing falſe and counterfeit myracles. Theſe your tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deſerue a rrigorous punishment, wherfore I giue ſentence, that you be forth with put to death.</p>
               <p>SS. <hi>Dioniſe, Ruſticus,</hi> and <hi>Euleutherius</hi> not shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anie the leaſt ſigne or token of feare, or baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mind, ſaid with a cheerfull countenaunce: Let them, that adore your Gods, be like vnto them; we only adore the God of heauen; and by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and not by ſorcery, we haue reſtored ſight to the blind, ſpeeche to the do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b, health vnto the ſick, and freed many that were poſeſſed with the deuill. Let the miniſters of the Idolls do ſuch things if they can, to conſerue their credit &amp; eſtimation: but they are farre from working ſuch wonders, whoſe Idolls haue mouths, yet cannot ſpeake; haue eies, and ſee not; they haue eares, and heare not. They doe only kindle and nourish the fire, wherin they themſelfs burne; and they that ſerue them, shalbe partakers therof with them.</p>
               <p>Theſe words put the gouernor into a further chafe, ſo that he confirmed the ſentence of death
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:181136:123"/>and committed them to the hands of the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. So the glorious martirs were led forth of the city, to the toppe of a high hill, where they were to be executed. Then <hi>S. Dioniſe</hi> kneeled downe, &amp; lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp his eies and hands vnto heauen, ſaid: <hi>O Lord God omnipotent,</hi> IESVS CHRIST <hi>ſonne of God, Holy Ghoſt the comforter, holy and vndeuided Trinity, receaue in peace the ſoules of thy ſeruants; who, for thy ſake, do looſe our lifes. Ruſticus</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with a loud voice. <hi>Amen.</hi> After this the venerable and B. Prelat <hi>S. Dioniſe</hi> bad the heads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to do his office. And he being ready, began with him, and then went to <hi>Ruſticus</hi> and laſtly to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> and cut of all their three heads in that order.</p>
               <p>Although God permitted theſe his ſeruants to be put to death, as is aboue ſaid, yet was not he forget full of them; yea becauſe he would the more glorify them, and not ſuffer their bodies to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored, his will was to worke a wonderfull mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in that place. The headles body of <hi>S. Dioniſe</hi> aroſe on his feet, and tooke vp in his hand his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne head, and went, as it were in maner of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, untill it mett a vertuous woman, coming out of her own houſe, not farre diſtant from the place, where the holy ſaints were martired. The body of <hi>S. Dioniſe</hi> being come vnto that place, where the woman was, deliuered his head vnto her, as a pretious treaſure, and shee alſo receued it as a moſt goodly Iewell.</p>
               <p>The bodies of SS. <hi>Ruſticus</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill in the place of execution, and the headſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the other officers talked and deuiſed to

In the meane ſpace, shee ſent for certain Chriſtians ſecretly, who conuayed away and hid the bodies of the holy martirs. When the officers, and headſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their fill, they went out to looke for the bodies of the bleſſed ſaints, to haue put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe their lewd deſigne: and not finding them, they ſtreightwaies made a tumult, and threatned exceedingly ſuch, as had ſtollen them away: but the diſcreet woman appeaſed them with gifts, and with fair words, and ſo they departed quietly away.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians laid the bodies of the holy ſaints in a priuate houſe, without the walls of <hi>Paris;</hi> and after certein years there was builded for them a goodly ſumptuous and ſtately Church; where they now do reſt. They who do viſite their holy relicks, do obteine many graces by the interceſſion of theſe holly martirs.</p>
               <p>The death of theſe holy ſaints fell on the ſame day, that the Church celebrateth the ſame, viz: on the 9. of <hi>October,</hi> in the year of our <hi>Lord.</hi> 96. in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> or <hi>Traian,</hi> as others ſay.

               <p>Pope <hi>Calliſtus</hi> at this owne coſt, cauſed to be made a Churcheyard in the way called <hi>Appia</hi> (which is called the Churchyard of <hi>Calliſtus,</hi>) where many martirs are buried. In this Churchyard was afterward built the Church of S. <hi>Sebaſtian.</hi> therein are conſerued many relicks, and many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and litle chapples are vnder the ground, where maſſes were ſaid, in great ſecrecy, for feare of the Pagans.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:181136:125"/>faithfull was very much augmented; it was alſo neceſſary to encreaſe the number of prieſts and Deacons. and ſo it was permitted to giue holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at thoſe foure times of faſting.</p>

He alſo was the firſt, who prohibited matrimony betwene kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks, and apointed the ſame conſanguinity vntill the ſeuenth degree, though it after was limited to the fourth degree, as it is at this preſent. This good Pope gouerned the Church of God vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly 6. years. 2. months and 10. daies, in the which he gaue holy orders fiue times in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of <hi>December,</hi> and ordered 8.

The Church celebrateth his feaſt, on the. 14. day of <hi>October,</hi> which was the ſame day he was martired, in the year of our Lord. 224.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted that S. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope in his 8. ſermon, which he made of the feaſt of the tenth month, ſpeaking of the foure times of <hi>Ember</hi> ſaith. It was a comaundement deriued from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

               <p>But the one and the other of theſe authorities is not againſt that which is here written. for if S. <hi>Leo</hi> ſay, that this faſt was deriued from the holy Ghoſt, we may ſay, it is true: and yet the introducing thereof into the Church was by the meanes of this good Pope <hi>Calliſtus.</hi> And where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſaith: it was inſtituted by the Romaine Church, the meaning is; that ſome Pope brought it in vſe, which of neceſſity muſt be a holy man, and of a very auncient time.</p>

                  <hi>The vſe of Images in the Church is approoued by the Church, as holy and profitable. Among other the vtilities therof, this is one; that Images are the books of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and vnlettered: for in them they ſee that painted, which other men read in books.

               <p>THe city of <hi>Antioch</hi> hath alwaies bene renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the faithfull, for that they took the name of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in that place, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they which profeſſed the Ghoſpell and faith of IESVS CHRIST, were called diſciples. In this city was S. <hi>Luke</hi> borne of noble parents. Form his childhood he was inclined vnto vertue, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued chaſtity right wel, for he obſerued it all his life. He was ſuch an enemy vnto Idlenes, that euen in his childhood, becauſe he would not be idle, he gaue himſelf to ſtudy the Greek toung. Then he paſſed to the ſtudy of philoſophy, and phiſick, and when he found himſelf dulled with ſtudy, he vſed for his recreation to paint. And though any of theſe ſtudies require a mans whole atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, yet had
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:181136:127"/>wit, that he proued a good philſopher, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent phyſition, and a famous painter.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Antioch, S. Luke</hi> thought, that if the fame was true, he deſerued, that people should go and ſee him from the vt moſt parts of the earth. but he, eſpecially being a phiſition, hearing it reported, that IESVS healed the ſick ſo eaſily, peraduenture had a greater deſire to ſee him, then others, and in caſe it was done by art, and might be learned, to be tought by him. He went to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and heard ſome of his ſermons, which made ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in his mind, that although he was very rich in poſeſſions, and worldly goods, and that he ſawe them, that followid him, forſook all, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſe they were not admitted into his ſchoole, deſiring yet to be his diſciple, and to keep in his company, he left and abandoned all his worldly goods and poſeſſions, as eaſily, as one would haue shaken the duſt from his feet, when they are to be washed. So he came into his B. company, and IESVs receaued him to be his diſciple, and ſo he remained, and was partaker of many miſteries, which our Lord wrought in the world.</p>
               <p>He was ſent to preach when the other diſciples were ſent by two and two into ſondry coſts. He was in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at ſuch time, as our B. ſauior died. And for that he had heard him ſay, that he would riſe againe the third day, he ſtaied till then, on which day he (according to the opinion of ſome Authors) being accompanied with another diſciple called <hi>Cleophas,</hi> determined to iourney from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> vnto the caſtell of

They went in this iourney diſcontent, talking together of the things which had befallen in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and whileſt they talked, IESVS ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them in the shape of a traueller, and kept them company.</p>
               <p>In their communication and conference, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued them for their litle faith, and inſtructed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in many things, and reduced to their memory many ſayengs of the prophets, which showed, that CHRIST muſt ſuffer and dy, and then riſe againe. finally, being come neere the caſtell; he made as though he would go further, but at their requeſt, he ſtaied ſtill with them. And being ſet at the table, they knew by breaking of bread, that he was IESVS, who was riſen againe. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſpeedily to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to bring this good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes vnto the Apoſtles, and there, and in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they ſawe him ageine.

                  <hi>Hilarion</hi> had a great deſire to ſee him in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, which when he had done, he chaunged his ordinary clothes, and put on ſuch weedes as the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks that were in the company of S. <hi>Antony</hi> wore, with whom he alſo ſtaied two months: In this time, he marked the order of his life, his grauity in behauior, his inceſſant praier, his humility in the entertainment of ſtraingers, his ſeuerity in correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offenders, the auſterity he vſed toward his body in diet, apparell, and ſleeping. he ſawe the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people, which came from all coſts vnto him, to obtein remedy and help for all maner of neceſſities, by his interceſſion and praiers. <hi>Hillarion</hi> thought, that this was the beginning of the reward of the long endured trauels of <hi>Anthony;</hi> and that he should do well to follow his ſteppes. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determined, he returned into his country, where the found his father and mother deceaſed, wherfore he diuided his patrimony, and beſtowed part on his brethren, and part on the poore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in mind theſe words of CHRIST: <hi>He that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:181136:130"/>doth not renounce all that he poſeſſeth, cannot be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> At that time <hi>Hillarion</hi> was 15. years old, and by this means being poore, yet accompanied by CHRIST, he went vnto a deſert place, which was haunted by robbers. Wherfore, they that heard of his boldnes, wondered therat; and told him, in what danger he was like to be, by dwelling there: but he feared no temporall perill, to eſcape eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death.</p>
               <p>This holy ſaint was of a weak complexion, ſlender and leane, but in mind he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to endure all maner of heat and cold, though it afflicted him neuer ſo much: neuertheleſſe he was clothed with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His diett was this: after the ſetting of the ſonne, he took 15. fruits of <hi>Carica,</hi> which is a fruit peculier to <hi>Siria,</hi> much like figgs. but bicauſe as it hath bin ſaid aboue, many rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers dwelt in thoſe deſerts, he ſtaied not long in a place, ſo that he had no cell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucifer</hi> being much aggreiued to ſee himſelf ſo ouer maiſtred by a monk, before he had beganne warre againſt him, began nowe to moleſt him with ſundry temptations. He repreſented vnto him filthy and laſciuious things, ſo that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God was enforced to think of that which he knew not; and to haue that in his imagination which he had neuer proued nor tried. He was wroth with himſelf, and knocked his breſt at this, thinking he was able by force to vanquish this temptation with blowes; he was enraged againſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:181136:131"/>his own body, and ſaid vnto it: Thou Aſſe, I will ſo vſe thee, that thou shalt not kicke: for I will take thy prouender from thee, and I will giue thee no meate but ſtrawe. I will quell thee with hunger and thirſt, and will lay heauy loads on thy back. I will torment thee with heate and cold, and will make thee to haue more mind of thy meat, then of thy pleaſure. This ſaid the bleſſed yong man, and as he ſaid, ſo he did. for the continued ſome times 3. or 4. daies with out meat; and yet he laboured hard in digging the ground, not entending to ſowe any graine theron; but only to get out the thorns and euill herbes, that budded in his owne body. He alſo made baskets of bulrushes, as the monks of <hi>Egipt</hi> vſed to do, yet not omitting for it his orai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; wherin he ſpent the greateſt part of the night and day. When he felt his body faint and weak by trauell, he tooke ordinary diet, which was a few wilde herbs, &amp; whilſt he eate, he ſaid to his body: Take heed my body: for thou shalt not eate, before thou doſt faint: and for that thou nowe doeſt eate, prepare thee, and fall to thy labour. By this courſe, he brought his body to ſuch a ſtate, that he had nothing on it, but skinne and bone.</p>
               <p>The holy hermite was one night at his praiers, and he heard the crieng of children, the weeping of women, the alarums of armies, the bleating of sheep, the bellowing of bulls, the roaring of lions, the hiſſing of ſerpents, and ſundry voices of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent monſters. At the firſt hearing, he was ſome what affrighted therwith: but calling to his mind the craft of the deuill, he fell flat on the ground, and made the ſigne of the Croſſe. And as he looked
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:181136:131"/>on either ſide, if with his eis he could diſcerne what it was that he had heard with his eares; (the moone shining bright,) he ſawe ſodeinly, a chariot drawn by furious horſes, who made a shewe, to kick, and runne ouer him. The holy young man with a zelous and feruent voice, called on IESVS, and in an inſtant he ſawe the earth to open and to ſwallow the chariott, and ther with departed the noiſe and fear the chariott made. The bleſſſed man rendered thanks to God, ſaing that which the Iſraelits ſaid, when the red ſea ouer whelmed and drownes <hi>Pharao</hi> and all his hoaſt. Viz: <hi>Our Lord hath drowned in the ſea, the horſe and the horſeman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many other were the temptations where with the deuill did try him, Sometimes as he lay reſting on the earth, to giue a litle repoſe vnto his afflicted body, there was preſented before his face naked women, an other time, when he was mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with famine there appeared vnto him moſte coſtly tables, couered and loden with many delicate viands, If he was at his praiers, wolfs ſemed to go about him houling, If he ſong himnes in prais of our Lord, he ſawe ſome braule or fray made before him, and ſome of them ſemed to be dead at his feet, ſeeming to ſay: <hi>Burime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On time being at his praiers, and ſome what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, as thinking vpon ſome thing not belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to his oraiſons, there came cloſe to him a grime and ſtern fellow, like vnto thoſe they call Sworde players, in <hi>Rome,</hi> and gaue him two ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible kicks on the ſides with his feet, and then with a whippe, lashed him on the shoulder, ſaieng to him; Holla what nowe? why doeſt thou ſleep.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:181136:132"/>and hauing ſaid this, laughed out of meaſure. And hauing thus ſoundly beat him, ſaid to him ageine: Wilt thou haue a litle barley: but <hi>Hillarion</hi> ſaid not a word vnto him.</p>
               <p>This holy ſaint from the age of 16. vnto 20. (to defend his body from the cold and from the beames of the ſunne, in the place where he ſtaied) vſed the shelter of a litle cottage made of bulru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and of another prickled herb called <hi>Carica.</hi> from that time afterward, he builded a litle Cell, which as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, ſtood vntill his time: &amp; was 4. foot wide, and 5. foote highe, ſo that it was ſome what lower then he was, and ſome what longer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his body was So that it is was more like the graue of a dead body, then the lodging of a liuing man.</p>
               <p>It was his vſage to cut the heare of his head once euery yeare, and that at <hi>Eaſter.</hi> He ſlept vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a bundle of bulrishes laid on the bare ground, and had no other bed, all the daies of his life. He neuer chaunged the ſackcloth, which he once put on: nor euer mended it, for he ſaid, it was a thing ſuperfluous to ſeek finenes in a ſackcloth. He had by hart the greateſt part of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and after he had ſaid many pſalmes and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he recited a great part therof by order, and alwais continued in deuout and reuerent behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; for that he conſidered God allwais preſent, and ſpeaking with him.</p>
               <p>He vſed to alter his diet according to his years. in ſome years he eate lentills ſteeped in cold water, at another time he eate bred only ſteeped in water with a litle ſalt, at another time herbs and rootes
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:181136:132"/>were his only ſuſtenaunce, and another ſeaſon he did eate euery day ſixe ounces of barly bread with ſome litle pittance of ſodden herbes. when he came to be feeble and weak, he put a fewe oliues vpon the herbs, and this was dainty meate. And thus he ſpent the time vntill he was 63. years old. from this time vnto 80. he would eate no bread, nor any other thing, but a certein meat made of flowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and of ſtamped herbs mingled together, which ſerued him both for meat and drink.</p>
               <p>This thing may cauſe men rather to wonder, then to put any in hope to be able to imitate him, becauſe the grace of God ſtrengthened him, and the long vſe of therof, and abſtinence in his youth from all carnality, which debilitateth the body, made it to him more eaſy, and more able to liue ſuch an auſtere life; wherin he merited much: and perhaps an other man should offend God by shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening his daies in doing the ſame.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> liuing now in his cabbin, the thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues had notice, and came to him, but ſeeing the eſtate he was in; they ſaid vnto him ſcoffingly: What wouldeſt thou do, to ſee they ſelf aſſailed by thieues? He aunſwered: The poore and naked man feareth not the thief. They replied: At left thou maiſt loſe they life: And he ſaid: It is true, they may depriue me therof, but I care not a beane, if they do ſo at this preſent. The thieues were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and amaſed to heare his words, and to ſee his conſtancy, which might haue bene a motiue for them to amend their life ſpent in wickednes, ſeing a man, that had choſen rather to lead ſuch a ſtreight life, then to fall into any offence toward God.

               <p>Vpon a day a woman came vnawares vnto him, and fell at his feet, shee perceiuing, that he ſeemed to be diſpleaſed to ſee her in that place, and to make ſignes, to haue her depart, she shed many rears, and ſaid vnto him; Oh Seruant of God, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my preſumtion, and boldnes, for my great afflictions enforce me ſo to do.

The woman made aunſwer: That this, 15. years she had bene maried, and neuer had child, for: which cauſe her husbande determined to depart from her, and leaue her deſolate.

               <p>After this fellowed another mroe wonderfull: viz: A noble lady returned home from viſiting S. <hi>Antony</hi> with her three litle ſonnes, and being come vnto <hi>Gaza,</hi> all three fell ſick there, and died, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was by the chaunge of the aire, or whether God would haue it for the honor of <hi>S.

And hearing that in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, nere vnto the city, <hi>Hilarion</hi> did Dwell, came vnto him accompanied with two hand maies, and ſaid vnto him with vnſpeakable grief: I beſech thee o holy man by IESVS CHRIST, by his ſacred bloud to come with me, vnto the city of <hi>Gaza,</hi> and raiſe my three ſonnes, lying dead in that place, which thing wilbe for the glory of God, and the confuſion of the Idollaters.</p>

This mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was diuulged in many places, wherfore much people reſorted, only to ſee the holy man. And many that were heathens and pagans by the only ſight of him, receued the Chriſtian faith, and took the order of monaſticall life, and ſtaie with him. There had not bene before his time any monks in <hi>Siria,</hi> ſo that S. <hi>Hilarion</hi> was the firſt bringer of that holy inſtitution, and to liue in monaſteries, in to thos parts.</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:181136:134"/>
               <p>There was brought to him a woman, who had bene blind ten years, and had ſpent all her goods in phiſike: which when S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> vnderſtood, he ſaid vnto her. It would haue done thee more good to haue giuen all thy poſſeſſions vnto the poore, bicauſe IESVS CHRIST would haue cured thee. When he had ſaid this, he laid a litle of his ſpittle vpon her eies, and incontinent shee recouered her fight perfectly.</p>
               <p>There was in <hi>Gaza,</hi> a <hi>Chariott man</hi> poſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the deuill, who had left nothing free in him, but his toung.

               <p>Another man called <hi>Marſitas</hi> was able and did cary on his back 15. bushells of corne, and was in great eſtimation for it, for there was neuer an aſſe in all <hi>Siria,</hi> that was able to carry ſuch a load. Into this man the deuill entred, and made him ſo fierce, that he did much harme, and it was in vaine to bind him with cords, or chaines, for he brake them all in ſonder. One while he aſſailed this man, another time that man; and with his teeth did bite of the noſe of ſome, and the eares of others. He was led vnto S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> in ſuch ſort, as men vſe to lead a bull, when he goeth to be baited. When the monks ſawe him, they were all afraid, becauſe he was a man of a great ſtature, of a terrible aſpect, and of a grimme countenance. S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to vnloſe all his bands, and to take

               <p>There was brought alſo vnto him another man poſeſſed with the deuill, whoſe name was <hi>Orion,</hi> a very rich man, who had a legion of Deuills in him. S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> expounding a paſſage of holy writte vnto his monks, the roan poſeſſed came on a ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein, and flipping out of the hands of them that led him, ranne toward the holy ſaint, and took him vp in his armes, and hoiſed him aloft in the aire. All that were preſent, cried out, fearing he would caſt the holy man downe hedlong, being weak and feeble with continuall faſting. but <hi>Hillarion</hi> with a cheerefull countenaunce ſaid: Let me deale alone with this luſty wraſtler, and turning vp his hand, took him by the heare of the head, and threw him vnto the ground, and then ſett his feet on him, yea, he trode and ſpurned him with his feet, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: Here yee shalbe tormented, yee accurſed dinells; the poore man yelling and houling, and turning his face toward the ground.

               <p>In this ſpace were hard to come out of the mouth of this wretch ſundry and diuers voices, like a confuſed shout or noiſe of people, but laſtly,

I know, that vnto many, the name of a poore man is an occaſion of avarice. there is none, that giueth better vnto the poore then he that reſerueth nothing for himſelf. <hi>Oryon</hi> was much diſcomforted at his words, and lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat on the grount before him. wherefore the bleſſed Abbot ſaid vnto him. My ſonne, be not aggreiued or afflicted at it, for that which I do for my ſelf, I do alſo for thy good: If I should receiue thy gifts, I should offend God, and the legion of deuills should returne into thee againe.</p>
               <p>In the city of <hi>Gaza,</hi> there was a yong maid of good life, on whom a yong man was enammored. This man endeuouring by all meanes poſſible, to drawe her to his will, and nothing preuailing, went vnto <hi>Memphis</hi> and made his mind knowen vnto the inchaunters and ſorceres of the temple of <hi>Eſculapius.</hi> They gaue him a plate of braſſe,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:181136:135"/>wherin were grauen dredfull figures, and bad him lay it vnter the threſhold of the damoſells dore, and to couer it with earth, and then to ſay certein words, which they taught him. Vpon this, the damoſell took ſuch affection vnto him, and was ſo fonde, that it was rather madnes then loue, for she called fot him, with aloude voice, she ſcratched her face, rent her heare, and did other follish and rauing tricks:</p>
               <p>The father of the damoſell brought her to be holpen, vnto S. <hi>Hilarion,</hi> and the deuill who tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented here, howled and ſaid: I haue ben enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to come hither, I was well in <hi>Memphis.</hi> Alas howe great be the torments, I endure? thou doeſt commaund me, to come forth, and to depart, and I am bound vnder the threshold of the dore, in a plate of braſſe. I cannot depart from hence, vntill the yong man, who hath ſet me here, do vnlooſe me. S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> ſaid vnto him; Is thy force then ſuch, that a plate of braſſe doth keep thee in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dag? Tell me nowe, why art thou ſo bold as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this handmaid of our Lord? The deuill aunſwered: I came in, to preſerue her virginity, Ah villanie, ſaid the holly ſaint, wouldeſt thou, that art the enemy of chaſtity, preſerue her virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Why didſt not thou take poſſeſſion of him, who ſent thee hither. The deuill replied: why should I do ſo, for he is a frend to the deuill my companion.</p>
               <p>To conclud, S. <hi>Hilarion</hi> deliuered and ſet free the damoſell, and would not haue the impediment the deuill named, to be taken away, to shew, that nether magick, nor inchanntment are of power to

               <p>S. <hi>Antony</hi> wrote ſome letters vnto this holy ſaint, and reioiced to haue aunſwer from him againe. And if at any time there came any ſick men to him from <hi>Siria,</hi> he ſaid vnto them: Why do you fetch ſuch long iourneis hither to me, and haue my ſonne <hi>Hillarion</hi> in your owne countrey?</p>
               <p>There were nowe many Monaſteries founded, and the holy man viſited them at vſuall times, and as he went to viſite them one time in this maner, he came by the way vnto a territory called <hi>Eluſan,</hi> and found them celebrating the feaſt of their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Venus,</hi> in her temple. When the people, though they were Idollaters, went out to meet and receue him (for they had bene much obliged vnto him for doing good vnto many of them.) The holy ſaint enterteined them louingly, &amp; wept for tendernes of hart, &amp; looking ſtedfaſtly toward heauen, beſought them rather to adore IESVS CHRIST; then thoſe ſtockes and ſtones; and if they would do ſo he promiſed, he would come and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite them oftentimes. Theſe ſimple words void of retorike were ſo forcible with that rude nation, that before he departed thence he ſet downe a plott and the forme, for the building of a Church, and they moued him to make the heathenish prieſt, which made ſacrifice vnto the goddeſſe, a Chriſtian, which thing they obteined.</p>

S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> ſmiling therat went vnto another monaſtery of a good man, who beſought, yea importunated him to eate a few grapes, to refresh himſelf being faint with his long iourney. The holy old man ſaid: <hi>Accurſed is the man, that ſeeketh the refreshing of his body before that of his ſoule: Let vs first make our praiers, and pay our det, we own vnto God, after that yee may go vnto vineiard.</hi> When God was ſerued: S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> went vnto a high place, and bleſſed the vineiard, then he bad his flock to go and feed therin. The number of them, that went, was litle leſſe then. 3000. for ſo many he had in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; This vineiard did vſually euery year yeald 100. meaſurs of wine, and. 20. daies ofter the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had eaten the grapes, the vintage was made, and it yelded that year. 300. meaſures. But the couetous churle, who would not ſuffer any to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within his vineiard, had much leſſe, then he vſed to haue. and that litle, which he had, became ſower, and then he repented (but to late) that he had ben ſo churlish and diſcourteous toward the holy ſaint. This bleſſed old man had a guift of God, by the ſmell of bodies, of garments, and things, which any man touched, to know the vices they had, and to what euill ſpirit they were ſubiect; and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:181136:137"/>with what vertues they were adorned.</p>
               <p>Being now fully. 6; years ole, and ſeing the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titud of relligious men, that were vnder his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and the great concourſe of people, that came to him dailie, to haue remedy of their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he was much diſcontent there at, &amp; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſame: His religious men askindg him the cauſe, he aunſwered them: It ſeemeth to me, being eſteemed holy by men, that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded me in this life, for the ſmall ſeruice, I haue done vnto him. It ſeemeth to me alſo, that I retorne vnto the world, ſins vnder the colour of ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and mainteining the relligious men, there are preſented vnto me many occaſions of ſinne. His diſciples hearing thes words did watch him dilligently, eſpecially <hi>Iſichius</hi> (for the great loue and affection he bore vnto him,) fearing he would ſtrale away from thence.</p>
               <p>One a time a venerable matrone came to viſite him, with intention to go further, and viſite <hi>S. Antony</hi> alſo. He vnderſtanding her intention, wept and ſaid vnto her; I was alſo of that mind, if the gouernement of this monaſtery had not ſaid and with hed me, but nowe it is to late, for two dais ſince, the worle is depriued of that worthy father: This matrone credited his words, and went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and within a few daies after came vnto their eares, the newes of <hi>S. Antonies</hi> death.</p>
               <p>It were a wonderfull thing to conſider the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and gifes of this ſaint, his miracles, his abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and his profound humility. <hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſaith of him: I am amazed and aſtonied, to conſider the great enmity <hi>Hillarion</hi> had with worlely pompe
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:181136:137"/>and glory, and with the eſtimation of men. This bleſſed old man was viſited by prieſts by relligious men, by clerks, by all maner of people, and he to fly from honour, which was dome vnto him by euery one, determined to depart, and trauell into ſome other country. When this was knowen, he was beſet and enuirouned with more, then 10000. perſons, who beſought him not to leaue them but he ſtriking the earth With his walking ſtaffe, ſaid: I cannot abide that my God should be accounted a deceuier or a lyer. I cannot endure to ſee the Churchs demolished, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By thes words he ſaid: many gathered, that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto-him, ſome great euill and perſecution that should enſew vnto his brethren, as it came to paſe after, in the time of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the bleſſed man would not ſtay with them any longer: and told the people, he would neuer eate bit of ſuſtenannee if they did not permit him to go quietly; and they hindring him, be would not eate any thinge for ſeanen daies to geathey. They ſeing his reſolution to be ſuch, permitted him to depart in peace, thought it was much againſt their willes. and becauſe the good old man was ſo feeble that he could not trauell on foote, he rode, and chooſe for to keep him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. 40. monks whom he iudged to be moſt abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. and moſt prepared to abide trauell and paine.</p>
               <p>Paſſing with them through many countreis, he at the laſt arriued at the Cell of S. <hi>Antony.</hi> There he talked with the diſciples left by that bleſſed man and conforted them being ſadde for the death of

They alſo reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto him ſome of his miracles S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of two of thoſe monks for the place of S. <hi>Antony</hi> his buriall, they only knowing it. It is not knowen, if they did shew it vnto him or no, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe S. <hi>Antony</hi> had commanded them, and bound them by othe, not to diſcloſe it vnto any; and he did it, leſt any man should honor, or reuerence his body.</p>
               <p>After the death of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> for three years ſpace, it had not rained in all that prouince, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the common people ſaid it was, bicauſe the clements lamented for the death of that bleſſed man. They beſought S. <hi>Hilarion</hi> to pray for them, which he did, and then it rayned. Wherfore he was for that benefit highly eſteemed among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that country, they ſayeng: that God had ſent him vnto them, in the ſteed of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He departed from thence, and went to viſite two holy Bishops <hi>Dracontius,</hi> and <hi>Philo;</hi> who were banished from their churchs, by themperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi> for that they would not follow the hereſy of <hi>Arrius.</hi> Theſe holy bishops were comforted much to ſee S. <hi>Hilarion,</hi> who departed from them, and went to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and was lodged by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:181136:138"/>relligious men, neere vnto the city. When night came, he ſaddled his litle beaſt, meaning to depart, and when they asked of him, why he would go a way thus ſodenly, he aunſweted: leſt my ſtay be the cauſe of ſome great trouble.</p>
               <p>On the next day it proued euen ſo as he had ſaid: for thither came officers of themperour <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata, guided by ſome of the citiſens of <hi>Gaza</hi> to apprehend him, by order from that tirant; but when they found him not, they wondred, ſaieng; nowe we find it true, that hath bene ſaid vnto vs of this man, viz: that he is a coniurer and a ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, knowing things to come. Behold: howe he is eſcaped out of our hands?</p>
               <p>The B. Abbot went like a pilgrime in diuers countreis, but he was eaſilie knowen, where ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he came, for men poſeſſed with the deuill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered him. He knew that <hi>Iulian</hi> the renegat had made a ſearch for him and his diſciple <hi>Iſichius,</hi> with an intention to put them to death, if he had taken them. In which, becauſe he miſſed, he ſet their monaſtery on fire, and perſecured the monks with extreme rigour. But within a while after, the wicked emperour being dead, and alſo <hi>Iouinian</hi> who liued a very short time, <hi>Valentinian</hi> ſucceded in the Empire.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Hilarion</hi> was entreated to returne, and gather his monks together, and to reedify his monaſtery which he would not do, but rather be took ſea, to go and dwell in ſome Iſlands vnhabited, that the ſea might keep that ſecret, which the land did diuulge and publish: but he could not be hid, for the people came likewiſe vnto him in that place
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:181136:139"/>alſo.</p>
               <p>So he departed from that Iſland, and paſſed into <hi>Africk,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Cycile,</hi> where he made his ſtay vpon a cragey mountein In the day he made a bundle of wood, and laid it on the back of one of this diſciples, to cary vnto the next towne to be ſold and with the mony ariſing therof, they bought bread, with the which, thoſe few, that were with him, liued and ſuſtenied their lifes. He could not liue vnknown in that place nether, for a man poſeſſed with euill ſpirite, in <hi>Rome,</hi> cried out and faid: <hi>Hilarion</hi> the ſeruant of God is in <hi>Cycilc.</hi> So that many diſeaſed people came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to recouer their health by his meanes.</p>
               <p>By cauſe he perceiued himſelf honoured in that place alſo, he departed, and went into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> where was a dragon that deſtroied all the countrey deuoured the oxen and other beaſts, and killed the husband men, and the shepheres. The bleſſed, man hauing compaſſion on the people, cauſed a great ſtack and pile of wood to be made, and when he had praied: he commeunded the dragon to go vpon the ſtack of wood, and when he was on it, he bad the people ſet fire ther vnto, and thus the dreadfull dragon was brent and conſumed with fire, in the ſight of all the people.</p>
               <p>Then he determined to depart from that place alſo, for which cauſe, he was embarked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſea he was aſſailed by pirats. His diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with the others, that were in the shippe doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they should be ſlaine, but the good man reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them for diſtruſting in God. And Then ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the deck, he praied, and ſtretchinh out his
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:181136:139"/>hard againſt the pyrats, ſaid: <hi>Come no further this way:</hi> O ſtraunge and wonderfull thing: at the ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng of theſe words, they turned aſide, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back as ſwiftly, as though a ſtrong gale of wind had caried them away.</p>
               <p>The ſea was alſo obedient vnto him: for at ſuch time, as he was at <hi>Raguſium,</hi> the ſea ſwelled and roſe out of meaſure, and ſo much, that the people of the country feared all of them should be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown and drowned. The bleſſed old man took land, made the ſigne of the Croſſe in the ſand, and held vp his armes againſt the ſtorme, and the ſea was aſſwaged, and ceaſed incontinent, to the great admiration of all the country, who kept this deed in memory, and the fathers vſed to tell the ſame vnto their children.</p>
               <p>Another time as he ſailed, and not hauing any thing to pay for the fraight, he would haue giuen vnto the owner of the bark, a book, in the which he had written the foure Ghoſpells, with his owne hand, which he alwais carried about him: becauſe he had cured before time the ſonne of the maſter of the bark, he would not receiue the book of him, but he gaue him his fare, and rendered vnto him infinite thanks for his former benefit.</p>
               <p>Finally, this bleſſed old man remaining in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres,</hi> and hauing ſent <hi>Iſichius</hi> his diſciple, to viſit the ashes &amp; ruines of his diſtroied monaſtery, and to ſalute the monks remaining in that prouince, ſtaid in the city of <hi>Papho.</hi> vnto which place many ſick men, and men poſſeſſed came out of all parts of the Iſland, and the holy ſaint by praier healed them.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:181136:140"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſichius</hi> being returned from <hi>Siria,</hi> the reuerend father conferred with him of his departure from thence, which he did not vpon inconſtancy, but only to fly from credit and honour, which was beſtowed vpon him in that place: So hauing found out: a place not far diſtant from the city which ſtood out of the way, and was vnhabitable for the craggines, knowing that the going vp vnto it was very difficult, for they muſt go vp creeping with their hands, and that at the toppe therof was a pleſante and delightfull place, furnished with many trees and cleare founteins, and that (as the fame went) many euill ſpirits haunted, and vſed in that place, and therefore none was ſo hardy, as to dwell there: the holy man reſolued to make the ſame his habitation. There were ſome, that came to viſite him; yea many diſeaſed perſons: and among others, one ſick of the palſy, who was the owner of the place. Great were the conflicts and encounters the ſeruant of God endured in that place by the deuills, who did inceſſantly diſquiet him; becauſe he was come to thruſt them out of their long continewed habitation. The bleſſed man took thereat great conſolation, for that he had there ſome enemy with whom to contend and ſtriue.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Hilarion</hi> being nowe come to the age of 80. years (<hi>Iſichius</hi> his diſciple being abſent) fell ſick: and perceuing that the hower of his death drew nere, he wrote a ſchedule, or note of his hand, in which he left by his teſtament <hi>Iſichius</hi> his diſciple, to inherite all his treaſures: the book of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells written with his owne hand, his long relligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:181136:140"/>weede, the ſackcloth or hoode, with which it was couered. When it was known in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that the holy ſaint was ſick, ſome came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite him, and he charged them deeply, that aſſoone as he was dead, they should bury him in the ſame place where he dwelt, and that they should not keep him aboue ground the moment of an hower.</p>
               <p>When the pangues of death came, all things fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling but his ſences, which were perfect, looking with his eyes open, he ſpake to his ſoule, and ſaid: Depart forth nowe, depart, feare not: thou haſt ſerued CHRIST 70. years, and doeſt thou nowe feare death? In ſpeaking theſe words, he ended his life. His body was buried incontinently, as he had apointed; ſo that his death and buriall was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the city both at one time.</p>
               <p>His diſciple <hi>Iſichius</hi> being certefied of his death, returned into <hi>Cypres,</hi> and faining that he deſired to dwell in the ſame place, where is maſter did dwell, and was buried; after ten moneths paſſed, he ſtole away the bleſſed body of his maſter, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing his life for the ſame (for if the <hi>Cypriots</hi> had knowne it, he had bene ſlaine by them) and caried it into <hi>Siria,</hi> and buried it in his auncient mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, an infinite company reſorting thither to ſee it.</p>
               <p>The bleſſed body was found hole, perfect, and entier, and ſo were all his cloths and garments, euen as he and they were, when he was aliue, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting a very ſweet &amp; pleaſant ſmell. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, that vntill his time there had ben variance and controuerſy. for the <hi>Syrians</hi> ſay; they haue his body, as they haue indeed. and the <hi>Cypriots</hi> ſay;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:181136:141"/>they haue his ſpirite; but aſwell in the one, as in the other place, are ſeen many miracles, done by the interceſſion and merits of this glorious ſaint: but much more in the place of <hi>Cypres,</hi> for in that place the bleſſed father took great delight.</p>
               <p>The death of S. <hi>Hillarion</hi> the Abbot was on the 21. of <hi>October,</hi> and on the ſame day, the Church celebrateth his feaſt. It was alſo in the yeare of our Lord 379 <hi>Valentinian</hi> being the Romain emperour. <hi>Nicephorus Calliſtus</hi> wrote of this holy ſaint in the 11. book cap 14.</p>

Of all that holy and virginall companie onely one called <hi>Cordula</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained aliue, who through feare hid herſelfe at the time of that ſlaughter; but ſeeinge what had paſſed, and that all the reſt of her companions were martirized, being encouraged by the motion of our Lord,<note place="margin">A don. in ſuo Mart. <hi>21.</hi> Oct.</note> who had choſen them all for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the next day followinge diſcouered herſelfe, and was alſo martirized, as the Roman martiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge recounteth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>AINT <hi>Chriſantus</hi> was borne in the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> he was ſonne to an honourable Gentleman, of the order of ſenators, called <hi>Polemius:</hi> who together with his ſonne, and the reſt of his familie, came to dwell at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was moſt graciouſlie, and friendlie wellcomed, and honourablie aduaunced by <hi>Numerianus</hi> the emperoure. Being once ſetled at Rome, the greateſt care of <hi>Polemius</hi> was, to haue his ſonne <hi>Chriſantus,</hi> that was of a quick and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing witt, and great capacity, trained vp in learning, As <hi>Chriſantus</hi> was turning ouer manie bookes, and ſeeking out ſuche as were moſt for his purpoſe, it happened, by the eſpeciall prouidence of God, that he mett with one, wherein were written all the foure ghoſpells. He did peruſe them attentiuely; and read them from the beginning to the end: he plainely perceaued the ſteppes of darkneſſe, and shade of death, wherein he had walked; and that our ſoules had no other light, ſauing online CHRIST IESVS. And being deſirous to haue the riches, hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in that booke, more diſcloſed vnto him; and vnderſtanding, how a famous clearke in holie writte, named <hi>Carpophorus,</hi> lay ſecrett in a caue, for feare of the perſecution; he went vnto him, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:181136:145"/>with teares beſought him, to inſtruct him in the faith and the ghoſpell of CHRIST. Carpophorus did willingly accomplish his deſire: he inſtructed him firſt; and then Baptized; and laſty ſo confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and ſtrenghthned him in oure faith, that, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen daies after, he openlie auouched and taught in <hi>Rome,</hi> that IESVS CHRIST was the onlie true God. <hi>Polemius</hi> came to haue notice heereof: and, partly for zeale of his blinde religion, parely for feare of the cruell lawes, and punishments eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> he was greatly enraged with his ſonnes proceedings, whom he therefore committed to a darke and cloſe priſon, aſſigninge him his meate with a ſcant and verie hard allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance. But findinge this punishment was to litle purpoſe; and wrought no other effect in <hi>Chriſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> but online to ſtrengthen him in his faith; he tooke another courſe of kinde vſage, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ, and pamperinge; ſeekinge by the meanes of certaine bond woemen of his owne, yonge, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and gallantly attired to peruert him, and allure him to naughtineſſ; that leeſing his chaſtitie, he mighe the more eaſilie looſe faith. They brought him out of priſon: they apprailed him richely; they lodged him in a goodly chamber, moſt coſtly furnished and hanged: the woemen came in, to performe theire lewd and wicked intent: but <hi>Chriſantus,</hi> fearinge his frailtie and feebleneſs, lyfted vp his eies to heauen crauing helpe and ſuccoure of oure Lord.<note place="margin">Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phr. in vit.

               <p>
                  <hi>Polemius</hi> did iudge it more conuenient for his purpoſe, to ſeeke our ſome faire yonge gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, wiſe, louely, diſcreet and gracious, and matche her with his ſonne and make her his heire to the end, that she, as his lawfull wife, might work his minde, and make it more pliant; which the others, being ſeruants, could not bring to paſs. Amonghſt the virgens of <hi>Minerua</hi> they found out one called <hi>Daria,</hi> endued with all the rare gifts and qualities that might be deſired &amp; wished in a woman. They acquinted her with all theire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and purpoſes yet hardly could perſwade her to marrie <hi>Chriſantus,</hi> and vndergoe that taske of healinge him from that, which they called mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Not withſtanding at length the teares of old <hi>Polemius,</hi> and a ſtrong imagination that heerein she did her Gods great good ſeruice, did make her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and win her to doe it. She aparailed her ſelfe moſt goregeouſlie: she came into the place where the yonge mau was, with a comely behauioure; yert ſome what ſtreigning it to a light wantoneſs, aad heedeleſſ demeanure she aſſailed him with louely, and ſweet, but well weighed reaſons, and gentle termes, endeuoring to perſuade him, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and abandon that faith of CHRISTE, and marrie with her. But oure Sauioure was on <hi>Chriſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his ſide, to ſtay him from gliding into ſinne: he gaue his words ſuch a heauenlie grace; and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his minde ſuch forcible reaſons, that with them he conquered <hi>Daria,</hi> and made her fall into
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:181136:146"/>the ſelfe ſame ſnare wherein she laboured to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trappe <hi>Chriſantus.</hi> For moued by his reaſons, and powerfully drawen by the grace of God, she reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be a Chriſtian. They accorded to keepe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yre virginitie vnſpotted; and yet giue it out, and ſo poſſeſs others with a conceite, that they were married: by which meanes <hi>Chriſantus</hi> was freed out of priſon, and from the keepers hsi father had placed about him: <hi>Daria</hi> was baptized, and both of them did liue together, as brother and ſiſter, keeping theire puritie vndefiled.</p>
               <p>Now as it is the propertie of goodneſs, freelie to impart it ſelfe to others, and of vertuous people to deſire and endeuoure that others be partakers of that precious iewell which themſelues enioie, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of them counſailed all ſuche perſons, with whom they conuerſed, to receaue the faith of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte</hi> oure ſauioure, and leade a chaſte and vertuous life: and manie were perſuaded to embrace ſuch good counſaile; the woe men by <hi>Daria,</hi> the men by <hi>Chriſantus.</hi> This was ſpeedilie knowen ouer all <hi>Rome;</hi> and notice thereof came to <hi>Celerinus</hi> prefect of the cittie; who forthwith comau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be apprehended, and brought before <hi>Claudius</hi> the Tribune; apointing him to heare and examine theire cauſe, and, finding them guiltie, to punish them. The Tribune comaunded <hi>Chriſantus</hi> should be led to the temple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> where, becauſe he refuſed to adore the <hi>Idoll,</hi> he cauſed him to be moſt cruellie beaten. The executioners performed the Tribunes comaund, with ſo litle remorſe &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that his bones and bowells might be ſeene through his wounds. They caried him back again
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:181136:146"/>to priſon; caſt him into a loathſome darck dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon; loaded him with giues and fetters; and caſt vpon the ground manie filthie and ſtinking things. But in the ſight of the cruell officers his yrons were turned into duſt: and in ſteede of the ſtinking, noy ſome ſmell, there was a moſt ſweete and fragrant ſent. Then a Bulls hide was flaied and taken of, and <hi>Chriſantus</hi> naked was put thereinto, wherein he remained a whole day, expoſed to the ſcorching beames of the Sunne: though he receaued thereby no harme at all. They caſt him once againe in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, loden with yrons, which were ſtreight waies conſumed and turned to pouder; and manie lights appeared, which made the dark dungeon bright like noone day. They tied him vnto a poſt, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to beate him with rodds of yron; which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the officers tooke vp in theire hands, they became verie ſoft, and no man could ſtrike with them anie one ſtroake to anie purpoſe. At length the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune <hi>Claudius</hi> conuinced that ſo great wonders, as theſe, were not done by art Magick, but by the hand and power of God, the beames of whoſe grace did now beginne to enlighten his hart, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe at the feete of <hi>S. Chriſantus,</hi> and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing perdon for the harme which he had done him he deſired him to pray to the God he adored, and by whom he was aſſiſted in ſo manie and ſo cruell torments, to graunt him pardon for his ſinnes, and knowledge of him ſelfe. The like did all his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oures: whom the martin embraced moſt louinglie: and there were baptized all at one time <hi>Claudius</hi> with <hi>Iaſon</hi> and <hi>Maurus</hi> his ſonnes, and <hi>Hilaria</hi> his wife, all his whole familie, and the ſouldioures of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:181136:147"/>his charge with manie other people.</p>
               <p>The Emperoure <hi>Numerian</hi> aſſoone as he came to the knowledge of ſo great an alteration, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that all should be put to death. <hi>Claudius</hi> was caſt into the riuer <hi>Tiber,</hi> with a great ſtone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, and drowned: the reſt were behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Hilaria</hi> ſome daies after, being at her praiers in a caue, where the bodies of the martirs were buried, was taken by the painims: and as they were about to carrie her before the Emperoure, she craued ſome reſpitt to make het praier; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein she requeſted allmightie God, to take her into the companie of her husband, and ſonnes. His Maieſtie vouchaſafed to heare her praier, and she rendered her ſoule into his hands, and her bodie remained with the other holie ſaincts.</p>
               <p>The Emperour gaue order that <hi>Chriſantus</hi> should be brought to a priſon called <hi>Tullianum,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> to the common ſtewes amongſt nanghtie woemen: where, by the preſence of that holie vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen ſo ignominious and reproachefull a place was turned with her praiers into a chappell. For God did ſend in her defence a lion, who ſlipping of his chaines, and breaking looſe out of his den, laied himſelfe at the feete of <hi>Daria,</hi> with ſignes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens that he would defend her. Not long after came in a bold impudent youth, with intention to defloure the B. virgen. But the lion encounterd him, caſt him to the ground, held him downe with his pawes, and looked vpon her, as one demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, how he should vſe that wretched yong man. She commaunded that he should doe him no harme; and taking occaſion from the lions obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:181136:147"/>towards God, she ſpake vnto the man, and reduced him to the faith of CHRIST. He ſeing in what perill of his life he had bin, and how once he was rather dead then aliue, &amp; ſeing himſelfe againe free from all danger by the commaundment of the holie virgen, went preaching aloude throught all <hi>Rome,</hi> There was no other God, but IESVS CHRIST, whom the Chriſtians adored. The keepers of the lion came to haue him back: but he fell vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and caſt them to the ground, and ſtaid expecting the will and pleaſure of the ſaint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she, with ſo good an occaſion, did likewiſe acquaint them with the power and ſtrength of the faith of CHRIST; and they were conuerted thereunto, and became the publishers and preachers of the glorie and Maieſtie of oure Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Celerinus</hi> the Prefecte, informed of all this, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a fier to be kindled about the lodging, to burne and conſume the virgen and the lion together: but by the will of allmightie God, to whoſe power nothing is impoſſible, in whoſe ſight his martirs are renowmed &amp; glorious, the lion hauing recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Virgens bleſſing bowing downe his head, went through the flame with out burning, and through the whole citty without doing or recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing anie hurt or damage. After all this, <hi>Chriſantus</hi> was put vpon a torment called <hi>Armentarium:</hi> but the poſt brake in ſunder, his bands were vnlooſed, and the torches which were lighted, to burne him on the ſides, were quenched. Thoſe allſo, which would haue tormented <hi>Daria,</hi> had the ſinewes of theire handes contracted, with ſuch exceſſiue paine that they were conſtrained to let it alone. Finallie
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:181136:148"/>they led them out of the cittie, into the way called <hi>Salaria;</hi> where hauinge digged a great ditche or pit, both the ſaincts were put aliue into the ſame, and then couered and ouerwhelmed with earth and ſtones, and after this manner, iomtlie martired and buried.</p>
               <p>Manie Chriſtians had gathered themſelues once together in a caue, to celebrate the feaſt of theſe holie martirs. <hi>Numerianus</hi> the Emperour, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, ſent a companie of ſouldioures, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundinge them to ſtop vp the mouth of the caue, and let not one eſcape with life. There was amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghſt them a prieſt, whoſe name was <hi>Diodorus:</hi> he ſaid maſs, and gaue them all the B. ſacrament, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them to ſuffer that death with ioy, and conſtancie, for the loue of CHRIST: they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he did exhorte them, and ended theire lifes gloriouſlie in that place.</p>
               <p>The Churche doth celebrate the feaſt of SS. <hi>Chriſantus</hi> and <hi>Daria</hi> the 25 of October: and theire death was in the yeare of oure Lord God 284. in the raigne of <hi>Numerianus</hi> Emperoure.

               <p>Moreouer, he commaunded; that Bishops should not leaue of forſake their Churches to go vnto others which thing is agreeable with the condition of maried folks, who may not abandon their own wifes, for other women.

               <p>It is not knowen, how <hi>S. Euariſtus</hi> died, but that the Catholik Church hath &amp; doth account him in the nomber of the Popes which were martirs.

                  <hi>The lifes of theſe two Apoſtles, taken out of that which is written of them in the holy Scriptures, and out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Authors, was in this manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Symon</hi> and <hi>S.

               <p>It is not written, when or howe they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Apoſtle ship, but there is mention made of them in the Ghoſpell, when the names of the twelue Apoſtles are reconed: As alſo when IESVS CHRIST in the ſermon of the ſupper,<note place="margin">Ioan. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> ſaid: <hi>He that loueth me, shalbe loued of my Father, and I will loue him, and manifeſt my ſelf to him. Iudas</hi> anſwered him: <hi>How is this to be done, that hout wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to vs, and not to the world?</hi> CHRIST ſpake of his death, and of his reſurrection, after which they were to ſee him againe: for that he would manifeſt himſelf vnto them really and veritably in body and ſoule.

               <p>There is no other particuler mention of <hi>S. Iude</hi> nor of S. <hi>Symon</hi> in the Ghoſpell, but that they were prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in all places &amp; at all times, that the Ghoſpell ſaith; the Apoſtles were with IESVS. As at the banket in the deſert,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Io.</hi> 10.</note> when CHRIST fed much people twiſe with a fewe loaues, and a fewe fishes.

               <p>They fled alſo, when IESVS was taken in the garden, they ſawe him rayſed to life, not as a ſpirite, but the ſame that he was, before he died. Our Lord talked and conuerſed with them, as may be ſeene by the actions of <hi>Thomas,</hi> who touched the wounds of his hands and ſide: they ſawe him alſo aſcend into heauen, they were alſo preſent at the comming of the Holy Ghoſt with the other Apoſtles; &amp; when they receiued him, they receued alſo his gifts, and eſpecially that gift of toungs, with which they preached the Ghoſpell in diuers parts of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symon</hi> preached in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and <hi>Thaddeus</hi> in <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia.</hi> They kept company in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched therin together, as <hi>S. Iſidorus, Ado,</hi> and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Beda</hi> ſay. Aſſoone as they came into that country, all the Idolls, which before gaue oracles, became dumb. and whereas <hi>Baradach</hi> captain to the king of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whom ſome Authors call <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,</hi> hauing then in hand a great interpriſe, deſired to be enformed of the ſucceſſe therof by oracle,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:181136:151"/>and paſſed from one vnto another; at laſt one of them, bad him looke for no anſwer, as long as <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> Apoſtles of CHRIST were in the country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baradach</hi> cauſed them to be ſought out; and brought before him. He dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded who they were: from whence they came; and what they did in that ſame country. The Apoſtles aunſwered, that they were Hebrews, &amp; ſeruants of IESVS CHRIST: and that they were come into that country for the good of all maner of perſons, in teaching them the true faith, which if they receued, it should be the right meanes for the ſauing of their ſoules. <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach</hi> ſaid to them: when I returne from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of my affaires, I will heare you willingly. The Apoſtles ſaid: It shalbe better for thee preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly to confeſſe him, by whoſe meanes, thou maiſt ouercome thine enemies, and reduce them to the obedience of thy king: <hi>Baradach</hi> ſaid: I think your God be more potent then ours, ſine that your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hath put them to ſilence: but, tell me: what ſucceſſe shall the warre vnto which I go, haue? The Apoſtles ſaid: To the end thou maiſt ſee, that thy Gods be not only impotent, but alſo liers, and deceuers, we will giue them leaue to aunſwer to thy demaunds, that they giuing an anſwer of that, which they know, we may showe what they be, and what they can do.</p>
               <p>The Gods anſwered by their miniſters (whom <hi>Baradach</hi> had cauſed to come thither) That the warre should be long, and that therin much ſlau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter should be on both ſides. When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles heard their anſwer, they laughed: and <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:181136:151"/>ſaid to them: I heare theſe words to my grief and ſorrow; and do you laugh? The Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: feare not, for too morrow at three a clock, there shall come embaſſadors from the Indian rebells vnto thee, who shall moſt humbly entreat thee for peace, and ſubmit themſelfs wholly to thy mercy. When the miniſters of the Idolls heard theſe words of the Apoſtles, thy ſcoffed therat; and in a rage againſt them, ſaid to the captein: Theſe fellowes come from the Indians thy enemies, that thou crediting their deceitfull ſpeeches, maiſt not be prouided and furnished with defence; and then the Indians may come and giue thee ſome notable diſcomfiture. To this the Apoſtles replied, and ſaid to the captein: we do not bid thee to tarry a moneth, or longer, but one day only: if thou find vs to ly, punish vs, as thou pleaſe. <hi>Baradach</hi> aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: I think beſt to keep you &amp; them alſo in priſon, vntill I ſee, which doth deceiue me; and then I will punish them that do deſerue it.</p>
               <p>On the next day, euen as the Apoſtles ſaid, the embaſſadours to the Indians came, with whom <hi>Baradach</hi> hauing concluded a peace, reſolued to punish ſeuerely thoſe falſe prophets. but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſtaid him, ſaieng: that thy were not come in to that country, to take away any mans life, but to giue it vnto many. Then the captein would haue giuen them many Iewells, but they would not take any. He had them vnto <hi>Babilon,</hi> where the king was; vnto whom he repeated what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen, betwene him and the Apoſtles; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them very much, and ſaid: they had the gift of prophecy, knew things to come, were hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:181136:152"/>and vertuous, and coueted no temporall gaine.</p>
               <p>At that time, the king had in his companie two magitians or Inchaunters, one was called <hi>Zaroes</hi> theother <hi>Arphaxat,</hi> who were fled out of <hi>India</hi> where S. <hi>Matthew</hi> preached, for that he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered their wickdnes and deceits. Theſe malli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fellowes, ſeeing the Apoſtles to be of the colledge and company of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> their deadly foe, perſecuted them, ſaieng of them much euill vnto the king: And with their inchantments, cauſed many ſerpents to appeare in the place, to terrify the Gentills, and to hurt the Apoſtles: but they by their word only commanded the ſerpents to wound the inchauntors, but not to kill them. The ſerpents obeied &amp; put them to great griefe and paine; and moreouer, hauing loſt hereby their reputation and credit, they were enforced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from <hi>Babilon,</hi> and to go vnto other cities.</p>
               <p>They laboured what they could, to do ſome miſchief vnto the Apoſtles; ſaieng in euery place, where they paſſed, that they were enemies to their Gods, &amp; would not haue them to be adored, and that they ſeperated wifes from their husbands vnder the collour of relligion, and ſuch other things. And in the places where credit was giuen vnto them, they gaue the people warning, that if the Apoſtles came that way, they should put them to death, and neuer ſuffer them to ſpeak. The holy Apoſtles preached the faith, without empeachment or contradiction in <hi>Babilon,</hi> and conuerted many, for that they did many miracles, eſpecially in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all ſickfolks from their infirmities what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. They baptiſed the king, and all his family, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:181136:152"/>hauing inſtructed many in the faith, they ordered prieſts, and deacons, and made <hi>Abdias</hi> bishop, who had followed them from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and had (as he ſaith) ſeen with his corporall eies IESVS CHRIST, in his mortall flesh.</p>
               <p>If fell out at that time, (as the ſaid <hi>Abdias</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth it, and S. <hi>Antoninus</hi> of <hi>florence</hi> repeateth it) that a woman, daughter to a noble man of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> was gotten with child, and the author of that wickednes was not knowen. She being vpon the time of her deliuery, her father and mother vrged her, to tell the man, that had dishonored her, that they might inflict vpon him ſome punishment, agreable to his deſert. Shee, to free her ſelf from further reproache, for that he was of ſo baſe a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſtate, that she was ashamed to ſay who it was, laid the blame vpon a deacon of the Apoſtles, ſaing: that he committed that villany. The deacon was forth with taken, and led before the king. The Apoſtles vnderſtanding therof, and knowing he was innocent, went to the court, and requeſted the king, that the parties, and the child that was new borne, might be brought before him; and ſo it was done.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle asked, when the child was borne: and they ſaid that the ſame day; then they looked on the child, and ſaid vnto him: we commaund thee in the name of IESVS CHRIST, to tell vs, if this deacon hath committed the offence, that thy mother chargeth him withall. The infant aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: This deacon is good and chaſt, and neuer in his life committed any carnall ſinne, and he is not my father. His ennemies vrged the Apoſtles
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:181136:153"/>inſtantly, to ask of the child, who it was, that had committed the offence: they aunſwered: It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs to cleare the innocent, but it is not fit for vs, to diſcloſe them that are faulty. And at this the wholle company remained aſtonied and amazed.</p>
               <p>The faith being well planted in that place, they departed from <hi>Babilon,</hi> &amp; went preaching through many prouinces of that kingdome, and at laſt they came to a very rich city called <hi>Suamir,</hi> in which place <hi>Zaroes</hi> and <hi>Arphaxat</hi> the two magitians told the miniſters of the Idolls, that the Apoſtles were in the city. Wherfore many of them aſſembled, and took the Apoſtles, and impriſoned them, and led <hi>Simon</hi> to the temple of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Thadeus</hi> to the temple of the <hi>Moone,</hi> for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore them: but at the praiers of the Apoſtles, the Idolls and their ſtatues fell in pieces, and to duſt, and out of them went two deuills, in the shape of <hi>Negroes,</hi> with horrible roaring and houling. The painims were moued therat with ſuch indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in a rage, and with infernall fury, they ranne vpon the Apoſtles, and cut them in pieces.</p>
               <p>At that time, the heauens and skie was cleare and calme: and one a ſodein, it was couered with black clouds, which powred downe a dredfull tempeſt, and withall fell many thunderbolts, which beat downe to the ground the temples of the Idolls nere vnto them, and ſlew many of the Painims, among whom were the two Magitians, whoſe bodies were afterwards found beaten to ashes. The king of <hi>Babilon,</hi> who was a Chriſtian, was much grieued for the death of the Apoſtles, and ſent men to fetch their bodies vnto <hi>Babilon,</hi> where
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:181136:153"/>he cauſed a Church to be builded vnto them, in which place they remained for a while. They were after ward caried to <hi>Rome,</hi> and laid in the Church of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The martirdome of theſe holy ſaints was on the 28. day of <hi>October,</hi> and on the ſame day, the Church celebrateth their feaſt. The Apoſtle <hi>Iude Thaddeus</hi> wrote one epiſtle, which is numbered in the canonicall ſcripture.

               </p>
               <p>DIVERS and ſundrie reaſons haue been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly alleadged, why the Church of God doth celebrate a feaſt of all the ſaints together. One reaſon is: the dedication of a temple, which was conſecrated in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the name of all the Saints. <hi>Ado</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and thoſe authors that write the liues of the popes and Emperours, relate it in this manner.<note place="margin">In chro aetat. <hi>6</hi> ano. <hi>604.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>About the yeare of our Lord 608. <hi>Boniface</hi> the 4. being pope, there raigned in <hi>Constantinople Phocas</hi> the Emperour, who though he be noted to be couetous, and cruell, yet was he a Catholique prince, &amp; very affectionate to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and a priuate friend vnto Pope <hi>Boniface.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There had been built in <hi>Rome</hi> a moſt ſumptuous temple, in honour of <hi>Cybele</hi> (that falſe goddeſſe, mother of all the Gods) and in the name of all the other Gods alſo. This was built by <hi>Marcus Agrippa</hi> a noble man of <hi>Rome,</hi> who called it by a greek name <hi>Pantheon,</hi> that is to ſay: the habitation of all the Gods. The temple is round, and hath no other windowe, but one great hole in the top thereof, which giueth light to all the temple. It is ſaid;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:181136:156"/>
                  <hi>Agrippa</hi> cauſed it to be built in that fashion, for that he would not shew himſelf partiall toward the Gods; in ſetting one in a more honorable place then another, but to make them all equall; and by the iudgment of thoſe, that haue skill in Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, it is held the moſt artificiall building, that is in our knowne world.</p>
               <p>Of this temple, with the conſent of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Phocas</hi> (becauſe he had iuriſdiction, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in <hi>Rome,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Italy</hi>) <hi>Boniface</hi> made a Church, &amp; conſecrated it to the mother of God, and of all ſaints. His reaſon was: that euen as the pagans in this temple, had adored the diuells, and all the crew of their heathenish Gods, with <hi>Cibele</hi> their mother; ſo from thence forth there should be honored in the ſame place, the Bleſſed mother of the true ſonne of God, and all the whole court of heauen, with the holie martirs alſo. For at that time they did not ſo ordinarilie celebrate in the Church the feſtiuall daies of the Confeſſors.</p>
               <p>The Pope called this feaſt, <hi>S. Mariaad Martires,</hi> and willed it should be kept on the ninth day of <hi>May.</hi> Afterward Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 4. who liued in the yeare of our Lord 827. (after the opinion of <hi>Onuphrius Panuinius</hi>) tranſlated the feaſt vnto the firſt of <hi>Nouember;</hi> becauſe of the infinite number of people, that reſorted to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſollemniſe that feaſt. Wherefore, he thought it more conuenient, to transferre it vnto a ſeaſon wherein the fruits of the earth were inned, and brought into the barnes, that there might be ſufficient ſtore therof, and no ſcarcity for the pilgrimes and ſtrangers; as there was wont to be, and is ordinarilie in the month of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:181136:157"/>
                  <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this preſent, that Church is called: S. <hi>Maria Rotunda;</hi> &amp; the daie is called; the daie of all ſaints. On the firſt of <hi>Nouember</hi> it is celebrated with great ſollemnitie, and marueilous concurſe of people to the honour of the B. virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and all ſaints. And this may be one of the reaſons why the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church celebrateth this ſollemnity. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon is: for that the Church endeuoureth to ſatisfie in honoring all ſaints in common; ſince it is not poſſible ſo to do in particuler feaſtes.</p>
               <p>The holie Ghoſt, by whom the Church is ruled, and gouerned, apointeth ſome feaſt daies of ſaints to be kept feſtiuall, beſides thoſe daies, which are kept holie in the honour of CHRIST, his B. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Apoſtles. The reaſon why feaſt day of one faint is celebrated more then another, may be: becauſe they were martired in <hi>Rome</hi> (which is the head of the world, and the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſea of the vicar of CHRIST, as long as the world endureth) as S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> and others. Or for that their bodies haue been tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thither from other countries, as S. <hi>Anastaſius,</hi> and S. <hi>Gorgonius.</hi> Or elſe, for that they haue been renowned martirs, as S. <hi>Vincent</hi> of <hi>Valentia,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and S. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> or it may be, for ſome other ſuch like cauſe.</p>
               <p>The reaſons of them all, are not knowne but ſecret. As of the ſaints which the ſame Church putteth into the <hi>Canon</hi> of the maſſe:<note place="margin">Sup: Canon Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So that it ſeemeth there is in it ſome miſterie, for the which it is fit, thoſe ſaints should be nominated and none other.</p>
               <p>And it ſeemeth to be the ordinance of God, that in ſome particuler citties and prouinces, the feaſts of ſundrie ſaints should be celebrated. As through all <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Popes do alſo obſerue the ſame order in Canonization of ſaints, concerning the ſaying of their office, and ſolemniſing of their feaſt. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he that is canoniſed, is to be holden, and reputed a ſaint of all Chriſtians, vnto all whom it is comaunded that they honour him as a ſainte; yet for the celebration of his feaſt, a place is ſet downe and aſſigned, or els a particuler congregation. As to S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Paula,</hi> founder of the order of the <hi>Minimes,</hi> his feaſt is kept in all the places of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in ſome citties; as in <hi>Towers</hi> in <hi>France</hi> where he died. Of S. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> alſo, who is canoniſed, and her feaſt is kept through all the order of preachers, and in the cittie of <hi>Syena</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:181136:158"/>
               <p>Of <hi>S. Romualdus</hi> founder of the <hi>Calmaldoly,</hi> whoſe feaſt is ſollemniſed in all the monaſteries of his religion, and in the cittie of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> where he was borne, and in the towne of <hi>Fabriano,</hi> where his body lieth, yea, not long agoe, Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> 13, hath granted a plenarie Indulgence to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans both men and women, vpon the feaſt day of the ſaid <hi>Romualdus,</hi> which is on the 19 of <hi>Iune,</hi> that shall viſite the Churches of the monaſteries of the <hi>Calmaldoly,</hi> aſwell of monkes as of nonnes; And the like is alſo, of many other ſaints.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this dilligence of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, there remaine many thouſands of ſaints, of whom is kept no feaſt nor comemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neither in generall, nor in particuler, yea, of many there is no memory nor knowledge. Of theſe then, which be an infinite number is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the feaſt of all ſaints. Which is a reaſon of great conſolation, for afflicted and tormented mindes; for though when the ſacred ſcripture maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe which be ſaued, it is done with ſuch reſtriction, and limitation, that it maketh the moſt valiant to tremble, and deſmaieth the faint and weake harted: As it is ſaid of them that departed out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> that of ſo many thouſands, two only entred into the land of promiſe; and alſo when CHRIST ſaith: that <hi>the gate of heauen is narrow, and the way by which we go thither ſtraite:</hi> As alſo when he ſpeaketh of rich men, and ſaith: that <hi>it is more eaſie for a Camell, to paſſe through the eye of a needle then for a rich man to enter into heauen:</hi> As alſo the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the ten Virgins, of which ſine were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the gate.

Iohn,</hi> where it is ſaid; that euerie tribe had ſo many thouſands of ſaints in heauen.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon, why the feaſt of all ſaints is kept, is: for that we be much bound vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for many graces and fauours, which we continually receaue of them, and by their meanes; &amp; for that cauſe it is conuenient, that in their memory we make ſome feaſt, &amp; reioice for the ioie which they haue, by poſeſſing the preſence of God in heauen.</p>
               <p>This obligement and bond is ſo great, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſollemnitie was inſtituted, by <hi>Gregorie,</hi> or <hi>Boniface,</hi> ſome Catholiques, and deuout Chriſtians, were in particuler perſwaded to celebrate ſuch a feaſt; of which number S. <hi>Anguſtine</hi> was one, who ſaith in a ſermon: my deare and louing bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we celebrate the feaſt of all ſaints vnder one ſollemnitie, of whoſe company heauen reioiceth,<note place="margin">Serm. <hi>27.</hi> tom: <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> and the earth is made happy by their aide, and the Church renowned by their triumphes. That the obligation and bond which we haue to the ſaints is great, we may ſee by this: that not ſpeaking of the fauours and graces, which we all receaue of God by their merits and interceſſion; there is not a man in this world if he look into his life, but he shall find himſelf obliged to ſome particuler ſaint, it being certaine; that God for his ſake hath done him ſome good.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:181136:159"/>
               <p>Moreouer, it is a cleare caſe, that we be bound vnto the ſaints, hearing CHRIST ſay of them:<note place="margin">Luk: 15.</note> that they feele an accidentall ioy, euery time that a ſinner doth repent. By which we may gather; that if they feele ſuch ioy, to ſee a ſinner bewaile his ſinues with teares, to knock his breaſt, to ſigh, and lifte vp his voice to heauen; if this muſick ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſe them ſo much, that for the ſame, they make publike ioy, and ſollemniſe his conuerſion: what Iubiley, triumph, and ſollemnity make they, when ſuch a ſinner is freed clearly from his ſinnes, and from the priſon of the body, and entreth into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? If the ſaints reioice ſo much at our good, it is very fit that we reioice by celebrating their feaſtes.</p>
               <p>The fourth, and laſt reaſon why we celebrate the feaſtes of all the ſaints is: becauſe we should imitate them. When the poore man ſeeth the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the rich, his pouerty is more apparent and manifeſt; and the ſinner ſeeth his defects better, when the vertues of the ſaints are repreſented vnto him.</p>
               <p>The Catholike Church celebrating the feaſts of the ſaints,<note place="margin">Greg: naz orat: in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſ: S. E pih<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here: <hi>26.</hi> Baſil: hom: in <hi>40</hi> m art:</note> doth not only intend to honor them, and God in them, but alſo would lay them before vs, for a patterne and example, to the end we should imitate them, if we would go whither they be gone, and be ſaued, as they are ſaued, and poſeſſe Gods glory as they poſſeſſe it. Aſſueredly we may ſay; that many that are called the diſciples of CHRIST, &amp; indeed be Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for that they be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed &amp; haue faith, in workes are Pagans, &amp; diſciples of the diuell, blinded, and deceiued, and that their conſciences be harquebuze proofe, as may be ſeene
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:181136:159"/>by that which followeth.</p>
               <p>In this feaſt of the ſollemnitie of all ſaints, the Church readeth a Ghoſpell, which was the firſt that IESVS CHRIST preached in the world. &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth the deſpiſing of all temporall things, and (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) compriſeth the ſomme of all that, which is neceſſarie for the perfection of a Chriſtian. He ſtaieth not on that point, but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to preach his new law and Goſpell, teacheth vs all to make ſmall account of things preſent, and to make moſt reconing of things to come; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the loue of terrene goode our of our hearts, and to direct our loue vnto celeſtiall things. This is quite contrary vnto that, which the world tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for CHRIST ſaith: <hi>Bleſſed be the poore;</hi> and the world replieth: Bleſſed be the rich. CHRIST ſaith: <hi>Bleſsed be they that weepe.</hi> and the world ſaith: Bleſſed be they that laugh. Our ſouiour ſaith; <hi>Bleſſed be they that ſuffer hunger:</hi> &amp; the world ſaith: Bleſſed are they that are allwaies full. Hereby we may ſee, of whoſe ſchoole euery one is, and whoſe diſciple he is.</p>
               <p>Some are troubled, vexed and tired, neuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king repoſe nor reſt, to get ritches together, to vſe delights, and pleaſures of the world, which are hurtfull vnto their ſoules; and yet they ſeeke after them ſo earneſtly, that they could not vſe more dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, if they should haue heard CHRIST ſay? They that ſeeke riches, delights, and pleaſures of the world, be happie and bleſſed. What folly and blindnes is this, to profeſſe thy ſelf a Chriſtiane, and to liue like a Pagan? Either liue as thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, or beleeue as thou liueſt.</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:181136:160"/>
               <p>In times paſt, there were in <hi>Athens</hi> many ſchooles of Philoſophers, different one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as the Stoicks, Academicks, Peripateticks, Pythagoreans, Epicureans, and Cynicks: &amp; euery one liued conformeable vnto the opinion of his ſect. You needed not aske of them, whoſe diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they were, for by their habite and behauiour, it was forth with knowne, vnto what ſchoole they belonged. You should ſee in a ſtoick a graue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, an honeſt behauiour, quietnes, temperance, conſtancy in one ſtate, and ſtabillitie like a rock in aduerſitie. In a Cynick an Epicurean, yee might haue ſeene the inconſtancy and vanitie of a diſſolute perſon, a ſcoffer, pratler, and taunter, ſo that euerie one showed in deed, what doctrine he profeſſed.</p>
               <p>It were well if euerie Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would do ſo alſo, to witt: that euery one in his countenance, his words, and workes, would shew himſelfe to be a Chriſtian, and the diſciple of CHRIST. That great Philoſopher <hi>Picus Mirandula</hi> ſaith very well: Not to beleeue the faith of CHRIST IESVS, and his doctrine, preached ſo plainly, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſo many miracles, is great obſtinacy. Then to haue, receiue, and to beleeue the ſame, and to liue contrary to that which it teacheth, is folly in the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>Is it not extreame folly (as that excellent and famous preacher <hi>Thomas de villa noua</hi> ſaith in a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) for vs, that fight, as we Chriſtians do, vnder the banner, and ſtanderd of CHRIST Crucified, to labour and ſtriue for riches, for delights, and pleaſures of the world? CHRIST our captaine is
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:181136:160"/>nailed on the Croſſe, naked, poore, shamed, and reproached; and we that be his ſouldiers, will (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) be rich, well apparelled, honored; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye all contentments, and pleaſures we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. Is it not a very folly for vs, that haue alwaies enioyed in the world conſolations, recreations, and all kind of temporall delights; and yet make account to be receiued into the ſocietie of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and company of the Martyrs?</p>

How can thoſe people that were euer rich, and laboured to be tenderly cherished, honored &amp; whollie poſeſſed of worldly delights, appeere among them that were flaied,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:181136:161"/>boiled to death, killed with clubbes, ſtoned or beheaded?</p>
               <p>The ſame IESVS CHRIST which ſaid:<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed be the poore. Bleſſed be thoſe that waile. Bleſſed be they that be hungrie. Bleſſed be they that be perſecuted;</hi> ſaith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after that. <hi>Wo to you that be rich. Wo to you that haue your content in this world. Here you haue it; and in the next you shall faile of it.</hi> As if he had ſaid: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that there be not two paradiſes. There were two before time, but becauſe man was rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious againſt God; he loſt the terreſtriall Paradiſe, and was caſt out of the ſame; to the end, he should not thinck of it, nor labour to obtaine it againe. And if he should ſtriue to obtaine the ſame, he should be aſſuered, neuer to haue the celeſtiall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe. for he that hath his paradiſe heere, let him not look to haue the other hereafter.</p>
               <p>So was it ſaid to the vnfortunate rich man, who being in the flames of hell lifted vp his eies, and ſeing <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> asked for one drop of water, to coole his tong in that flame; but he was anſwered: Remember thou haſt had proſperitie, therefore look not to haue it any more. All theſe things we are taught by the feaſt of all Saints, and the Catholique Church doth celebrate it, to the end we should imitate them.</p>
               <p>If we cannot imitate the Apoſtles, let vs follow the examples of the Martirs. If not the martirs, yet of the Confeſſors. And if not of the Confeſſors, let vs be ashamed at leaſt that eleuen thouſand weak, and tender damſells, hauing giuen their liues, to enioy that, which the holie ſaints in heauen enioy; any man should be ſuch a coward, or recreant

               <p>For all theſe reaſons before mentioned, it is iuſt and reaſonable, that on this daie we should do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto them all. And as <hi>S.

               <p>We muſt give reuerence of the Confeſſors, for the conflicts they had within themſelues, liuing in continuall penance, and mortification. We muſt beare reuerence vnto the virgins; as vnto the ſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of CHRIST: and vnto the other holie ſaints, and all the Angells of the Hierarchies, as citiſens of heauen, enioyeng the preſence of God.

It agreeth alſo verie fitlie, that the lions did not rent nor teare</hi> Daniell <hi>in pieces, alſo that the ſight of them was grieuous, in that place of paine, and alſo hunger afflicted him very much. So the ſoules that be in the paines of purgatorie be not tormented by the diuells, which is very iuſt; as not firt, that they should chaſtice thoſe, that they could not ouercome. The place it ſelf which is allotted vnto them, is painfull, and grieuous, for it is full of fire, which is the ſame with the fire of hell, (as S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>affirmeth) Honger doth afflict them alſo, which is the great deſire and longing they haue to ſee God; For though they be ſecure to ſee him at length; yet it is a great grief vnto them, that the time is prolonged.</hi>

                  <hi>The prophet</hi> Abacuc, <hi>who caried meat vnto his sheep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heards, is a figure, of euerie good and faithfull Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, which doth good vnto the ſoules in purgatorie. For in the carying of meat vnto his sheapheards, viz: vnto his Curate, or any other prieſt, in bringing bread and wyne vnto the Church, and the other almes, which are done for the ſoules (ſuch as praiers, and ſacrifiſes bee) an Angell cometh, and bringeth it vnto</hi> Daniell <hi>in the denne. And in deed, it is an article of the Catholique faith, that all thoſe things that be offred for the ſoules in
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:181136:163"/>purgatorie, by perſons that be in the state of grace: or elſe if the work it ſelf doth merit, and deſerue it, (as the holie ſacrifiſe of the maſſe) both comforteth and helpeth the ſoules that be in purgatorie exceedingly.</hi>

               <p>THE vndoubted veritie, that there is a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, is an Article of the Catholique faith, and he that denieth it, shall thereby prooue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an heretique.

IESVS CHRISTOUR our ſauiour ſaith the ſame, viz: that <hi>he that shall speak wordes againſt the Holie Ghoſt, shall not be pardoned neither in this World, nor in the World to come. S.

For they ſay: if ſinnes be not remitted in the other world, this ſentence, <hi>shall not be remitted in the other world,</hi> should not haue beene written. And the truth beinge that in all holie writt, there is not any ſuperfluous word, fot to ſay there were any (as S. <hi>Baſile</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Exameron</hi>) were blaſphemie; it followeth then, that there is a purgatorie: for it is a cleare caſe that no ſinne is pardoned in hell.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The religious man took land in the Ile, and found in an obſcure and ſecret place an hermite, vnto whom he went; and among their conferences the religious man told him, that he was of the prouince of <hi>Aquitaine</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> The hermite hearing that was very glad (as appeared by his countenance) and asked him, if he knew the monaſterie of <hi>Cluny,</hi> and <hi>Odilo</hi> the Abbot thereof. The religious man ſaid, yes: and deſired to know the reaſon, why he demaunded that queſtion. The hermite anſwered: know you that in this Iland be hollow places, full of wind and fire, which ſome call the mouth of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> by the which are ſeene divells to enter in, and to go out ordinarilie, in diuers and ſundrie shapes and formes.</p>
               <p>Sometimes by their externall looks they ſeeme to be cheerfull and iocund, and at other times they ſee me to be penſiue and ſadde. I being deſirous to know the cauſes of this different behauiour, adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and charged them in the name of Almightie God, to tell me the true cauſe; and they ſaid vnto me; that they make show of ioye and gladnes, when the ſoule of any perſon, that hath liued well in the world, whom they could neuer induce to committ mortall ſinne, is brought vnto purgatorie for ſome veniall ſinnes; and the diuells ſeing them
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:181136:164"/>to ſuffer in the flames are ſatisfied therewith, and shew their gladnes by externall ſignes. But if there be giuen any almes, any maſſes ſaid, or any good workes done by good people (as faſting and prayer) whereby the ſoule departeth ſooner out of that place, and flyeth vnto heauen, this cauſeth the diuells to be afflicted.</p>
               <p>They complayne eſpeciallie of the monkes of <hi>Cluny,</hi> where continuall prayers are made for the ſoules of the dead; that they may be deliuered out of that paine. Therefore I praie thee (ſaid the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie hermite) and I coniure thee in the name of God Almightie, to requeſt the Abbot <hi>Odylo,</hi> and the other to ſay maſſe, and prayers without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, for the ſoules in purgatorie; ſince ſo much good aryſeth thereof.</p>
               <p>The religious man wondred at his wordes, and promiſed him faithfully to deliuer the meſſage. So, being returned into <hi>France,</hi> he viſited that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, and recyted vnto the Abbot and his mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes all that which befell in thoſe caues, and mouth of <hi>Vulcan.</hi> The holie Abbot <hi>Odylo,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſame, ordeined, and commaunded, that in all his monaſteries, they should haue the ſoules in recomendation.

It is alſo very certaine, that by eſpeciall order, and decree of Almightie God, ſome ſoules haue their Purgatorie, in places particuler to them ſelues;<note place="margin">diolo: lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>40.</hi> &amp; <hi>55.</hi>
                  </note> as S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſaith of one, that had his Purgatorie in a Bayne, for his faultes committed therein; and it being manifeſted vnto a prieſt, and that he should cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Maſſe for him, he was quitte, and freed, and went vnto heauen.</p>
               <p>Concerning the paines of Purgatorie you muſt vnderſtand, that it is fire, and (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) it is the ſame, that the fire off hell is; and is yet diſcreet, and different. For as the naturall fire conſumeth the ſtraw, and puryfieth the gold; ſo this fire conſumeth eternally the ſoule in hell, after the manner of ſtraw; and the ſoules in purgatorie which be like gold, it burneth, and purifieth. It hath alſo another propertie, that it tormenteth not all men equally, and therefore it is called diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet fire, for it maketh one to feele more paines, another leſſe according to the faultes and ſinnes
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:181136:165"/>they haue committed.</p>
               <p>It is vſually ſaid thereof, and it is moſt true; that the ſtoning of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the grydiron of S. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> the arrowes of S. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> the Iron combes of S. <hi>Vincent,</hi> and all the martirdomes the ſaints endured, do not come neere the paines of them, that ſuffer in purgatorie. And there is as great difference betweene the one paine and the other, as betweene the ſoule that ſuffreth in purgatorie, and the bodie that ſuffreth heere in this world.</p>
               <p>There is adioyned vnto the paine of feeling, a greeuous longing, and deſire the ſoules haue to ſee God, which is ſo great, that in ſome ſort it doth ſurmount the paine of feeling, which is the fire. They ſee themſelues there without remedy, for any thing they can do of themſelues: &amp; they know they muſt paye the vttermoſt farthing, if they in the world do not help them. In that place doth afflict them the negligence and careleſnes of their kinsfolk, and friends; they ſorrow alſo for the ingratitude of their heires; and ſlownes of their excecutors, in acomplishment of their willes.</p>
               <p>They ſay many times with the holie man <hi>Iob: Haue mercy and compaſſion of vs you at the leaſt, who in the world are ſaid to be our friends for the hand of our Lord hath touched vs.</hi> we be in thoſe paines,<note place="margin">Iob: <hi>3.</hi>

               <p>Laſtlie you muſt vnderſtand, that to do good vnto the ſoules in Purgatorie, is not only profitable vnto them, but alſo vnto thoſe, that do it: ſins it is a work of great charitie, acceptable vnto God profitable to keep a man out of ſinne, and is alſo good for the health of the body.</p>

               <p>You muſt alſo vnderſtand, that there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene theſe workes: for that three of them (if they shall do the ſoule good) muſt be done in the grace of God, and if they be done other wiſe, they do not help them, except they be done by the apointment of another. And if that he, that commaundeth the good work to be done, (as to giue almes, or ſuch like) be then in the ſtate of grace; in this caſe the work is good and auaileable, and helpeth the ſoule, though the perſon that did that good work were not in that good eſtate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

               <p>Concerning the maſſe, and theſe other workes (as I haue inſinuated before) there is a difference. For that helpeth alwaies, not with ſtanding, that he that ſaid it, was not at that time in the fauour of God: for that he who offreth it, doth it in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Church, who is alwaies in the fauour of God; and therefore it helpeth thoſe ſoules alwaies for whom it is eſpecially ſaid, and celebrated. So that we may truly ſaie; that this is the beſt, and moſt ſecure work, that can be done for the ſoules in purgatorie.</p>
               <p>If this, which we haue ſaid, be the truth, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it is, viz: that the paines in purgatorie be ſo great and exceſſiue: and that alſo being true, which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, as it is for certaine; to wit: that to ſee God, one houre only, is of more worth then all the treaſures of the world; And ſithens with all them he cannot do that, which one may do with the good workes he doth for a ſoule in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie; that is: to deliuer it out of payne, and that it may ſee God before the time, it should otherwiſe ſee him. How greatlie and vnſpeakablie shall that ſoule be obliged, and bound vnto the perſon, that shall ſo help, to deliuer it? without doubt, more then can eaſilie be ſaid.</p>
               <p>And that ſoule being ſo much bound vnto any partie, (after it is heauen, and enioyeth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God) shalbe his perpetuall aduocate, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the diuine maieſtie, to be gratious vnto him, that hath beene ſo good vnto it, by procuring it to be freed from the fault, land deliuered from paine, purchaſing heauen, by enioying it, before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of this we haue an example in the two holie martyrs</hi> SS. Vitalis <hi>and</hi> Agricola: Agricola <hi>being the maſter, &amp;</hi> Vitalis <hi>the ſeruant.

               </p>
               <p>IN the perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> there dwelt in the citty of <hi>Bologna</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble citiſen called <hi>Agricola,</hi> who had a ſeruant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Vitalis.</hi> They were both Chriſtians, and for that cauſe were apprehended by the miniſters of theſe two cruell Emperours. Theſe holy Saints, being in the preſence of the Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ident; the ſeruant, to wit, <hi>Vitalis,</hi> was firſt put to torments, thereby the more to terrify the maſter. And becauſe ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be ordinarily ſcourged for their chaſtiſment, and do tremble and quake to ſee the whippes; it was the Iudges will, that the firſt torment of <hi>Vitalis</hi> should be ſcourging, and ſo he cauſed him to be beaten rigorouſly.</p>
               <p>After that, he put him vnto other manner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and herein, the Iudg was ſo cruell, and the officers ſo mercyleſſe, that the bodie of the holie martyr, was whollie couered with blowes, and woundes. So that ſearch neuer ſo narrowly, you could not ſee any thing but woundes, and gashes. There was not any blood left in his vaines, but all was shed, and the ſcourges, and wandes of Iron, where with they ſtroke him, hit not, ne touched not the whole skin any more, but the rawe flesh,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:181136:168"/>and the bare bones, ſo that his very bowells were ſeene. The glorious martyr lifted vp his eyes vnto heauen, and made a deuout prayer, ſaying: O my Lord LESVS CHRIST, my God and Sauiour; I humblie beſeech thee, that it would pleaſe thee to receaue my ſoule: for I deſire much to enjoye the crowne, which thy holie Angell hath shewed vnto me. His prayer being ended, he yealded vp his ſoule vnto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agricola</hi> was preſent at this ſpectacle, who being a man of good nature, pleaſing behauiour, friend to all, affable, doing good, and hurting none; was generally beloued of all. And therefore the executioners, yea, and the Iudg himſelf alſo, being deſirous to haue him change his mind, and to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto the Idolles, wherby he might be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from death; made him to be preſent at the martyr dome of his ſeruant <hi>Vitalis;</hi> to the end, he might learne, (as is ſaid before) to beware by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans coſt, and affliction. But he that had ſeene the ſucceſſe of his ſeruant, was more deſirous, to gaine a crowne as he had done, rather then to be terrifyed with the torments; and ſo he remayned firme and conſtant in his firſt good purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Iudge and the officers were wroth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt him. and the more, for that they had vſed him courteouſly, and he had deſpiſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned them; in which rage, the Iudge commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he should be put on the Croſſe. The executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were not ſlowe, to execute the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the ludge. Forthwith the Croſſe was brought, and <hi>Agricola</hi> was ſtripped naked. Then layd they him at length vpon the ſame, &amp; piercing his handes
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:181136:168"/>and feete with sharp nayles, they crucifyed him, lifting him vp a loft. In that place was to be ſeene, a wonderfull and liuely repreſentation of the Lord in his ſeruant, that is to ſay, of CHRIST in <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola.</hi> The holie martyr being thus raiſed on high, shewed, that he made ſmalle account of earthlie thinges, but deſired heauenlie. He hauing bene on the Croſſe a good ſpace, on the ſame daie, that his ſeruant <hi>Vitalis,</hi> yealded vp his ſoule vnto God by ſcourging, he rendred vp alſo his ſpirit on the Croſſe. And ſo the maiſter and the ſeruant, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in theire martyrdome, and in theire reward.</p>
               <p>Their bodies were buried in a Churchyard where the Iewes were buried; and in that place they remayned, as Roſes among thornes, and light in darknes, vntill the time of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as he ſaith himſelf, writing the ſtory of their martyrdome. But he hauing notice of the place, where they were, at the requeſt of a holie widowe called <hi>Iuliana,</hi> who had particuler, and ſpeciall deuotion to theſe holie ſaintes, took them out of that place: and tranſlated them into a Church, which the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <hi>Iuliana</hi> had builded vnto them; where their bodies take their repoſe and reſt, and their ſoules expect to be reunited vnto them, at the laſt daye of Iudgment.</p>
               <p>The martyrdome of theſe holie ſaintes, was on the 4. of <hi>Nouember,</hi> and vpon that daie, the Church maketh of them a commemoration. This befell in the yeare of our Lord. 298. in the raigne of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Diocletian.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereof the Catholique Church taketh the cuſtome, to celebrate the feaſt of the dedication of Churches; as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely in</hi> Rome <hi>is celebrated the dedication of the Church of</hi> S. Saluator. <hi>The hiſtorie thereof taken out of the life of</hi> S. Silueſter <hi>the pope, was this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>EVEN from the time of the Apoſtles, there was alwaies amongſt the Chriſtians, ſome eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall places dedicated vnto God, which of ſome were called Oratories, and by others Churches. Thither came the Chriſtians, and met together, eſpeciallie vpon the Sundaies, to heare the word of God, to be preſent at the diuine ſeruice, to pray &amp; to heare maſſe, and to receiue the body of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, in that moſt holie Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But after that the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was Baptiſed by S. <hi>Silueſter,</hi> and was healed by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes of his Baptiſme, not only in his ſoule of his ſinnes, but alſo in his body of his leproſie; he, as a perſon thanckfull to the deuine maieſtie, of whom he confeſſed to haue receiued this grace and benefitt, made a lawe, and published a decree, through all the lands ſubiect to the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> that euerie one might build Churches, where it beſt pleaſed him.</p>
               <p>And that by his example he might encourage others thereunto; in the yeare of our Lord 325. he cauſed a Church to be builded, in the honor of IESVS CHRIST, Sauiour of the world, in his owne palace of <hi>Lateranum,</hi> adorning it with many rich Iewells, and veſſells of Gold and Siluer, but
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:181136:173"/>aboue all, he beautifyed it with an Image, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting our Bleſſed Sauiour himſelf very liuelie; and this place was deuoutlie viſited, by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beleeuers.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Silueſter</hi> the pope conſecrated that Church, which was the firſt, that had bene publiklie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated among the Chriſtians, for the celebration of the diuine offices. In that place the ſame Bishop ſet the Altar, vpon which S. <hi>Peter</hi> celebrated the holie maſſe, and it was of wood, like vnto an emptie cheſt. The Apoſtle vſed this manner of Altar, euen as the other popes his ſucceſſors did, compelled by the neceſſitie of the time. For the perſecution being very sharp, the afflicted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans flying from one place vnto another, carried with them this portable Altar, to celebrate the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reon, ſometimes in the caues vnder the ground, ſometimes in the Churchyards, where the bodies of martyrs were buryed, and ſometimes in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate houſes of Catholiques.</p>
               <p>The mind of S. <hi>Siluester</hi> was; that this Altar should remaine for a memorie, in the firſt Church of the Chriſtians, and comaunded: that none but the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> should celebrate vpon it. And that all other prieſts should celebrate, not vpon an Altare of wood, but vpon an Altare of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated ſtone. And to the end, the memory hereof should continew, and be perpetuall, he ordained: that euerie yeare the dedication of this Church should be celebrated. And this is the feaſt which is ſollemniſed on the 9. day of <hi>Nouember.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a thing very neceſſarie and conuenient, that among Chriſtians there should be ſome places
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:181136:174"/>dedicated vnto God; as Churches, and Oratories bee; to the end they might reſort thither, to pray, &amp; demaund help of God in their needes and troubles. For if in citties, and other townes, be diuers shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes for perticuler thinges; and if in the houſe, be ſeuerall roomes for ſundrie offices, it is alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that among the multitude of Chriſtians, there should be ſome places, where they may treat, and ſpeak with God. And theſe being dedicated to ſuch a worthie work, it is alſo conuenient that they should be conſecrated; and alſo, that all due reſpect, and reuerence be giuen vnto them.</p>
               <p>All this our Lord would giue vs to vnderſtand, by the example of the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the workmanship whereof was of exceeding great Maieſtie, as may be ſeene in two things eſpecially, which the holie ſcripture reciteth, to witt: That in the Temple there was not a thing, but it was of Gold, or ingraued, or ſet in Gold. The other was, that the fabrick, or workmanship being ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, and ſtately, yet in all the time of the building thereof, there was not heard the noiſe of hammer, or any other toole therein.</p>
               <p>Some expound theſe words thus; ſaing: that this was a kind of ſpeech commonly vſed, when they would shew, what ſpeed a thing hath beene done withall, as when it is ſaid: ſuch a thing was done before it was ſeene or heard. So although the work of the Temple laſted many yeares, yet in reſpect of the hugenes and magnificence thereof, it may be ſaid: that therein was not ſeene, nor heard the ſtroke of an hammer. Others ſay: that euery thing was brought thither ready wrought,<pb n="323" facs="tcp:181136:174"/>from other parts, and that they did nothing, but lay and couch things in their due place. And ſo this Temple was a figure of the B. Martirs, who are hewed, and ſquared in the Quarries of this world, ſuffring heere diuers troubles and afflictions: but then in heauen, they ſuffer no more ſtrokes, nor feele more troubles, but haue their reward for that, which they haue borne, and ſupported in the world.</p>
               <p>In theſe things then is shewed the ſtatelines, and magnificene of this Temple; In the which, although it was the Temple of God, yet was there only in it the Ark of the Teſtament, and that not alwaies neither; for at the time of the captiuitie of <hi>Babilon,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> hid it in a hill; and then they put into it another made like it, and yet for all that, it was greatly honoured not only by men, but euen by God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Then by greater reaſon ought we, to reuerence, and honour our Churches, in the which reſideth IESVS CHRIST true God, and true man, and that really, in the B. ſacrament of the Altare. There are not ſacrificed Bulles, and weathers, but the vnbloodie ſacrifice of IESVS CHRIST, vpon the Altar of the Croſſe, is there repreſented; where he is offred in a liuely ſacrifice to his eternall father, for the ſaluation of mankind; and the ſame doth the Prieſt daily in his name, in the holie ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>In our Churches be alſo the ſacraments, by which are healed, and cured ſundrie infirmities. Some be weak, to encounter and fight againſt the Diuell, the world, and the flesh, and to make ſuch
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:181136:175"/>men able and ſtrong, the ſacrament of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is giuen vnto them. To others, for the ſame pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>poſe, and to make them rich in vertue, there is giuen the ſacrament of the holie <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> And to the end others should be continent, the ſacrament of Matrimonie is giuen vnto them For others, that be wounded, hurt, and ready to die of ſundrie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and they whoſe ſoules are already and whollie dead in mortall ſinne, are prouided the ſacraments of penance, and extreame vnction. So that the Church is as an Apothecaries shop, ſtored with ſpirituall medicines, for all the infirmities and maladies of the ſoule, and body alſo.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, in the Catholike Church be the treaſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the Church is preached the Goſpell, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the commaundments of God is taught vertue is comended, and vices be reprooued. So that in it ſome are ſtroke with feare, ſome haue compunction, theſe weepe, others reioice; ſome are comforted, and others are inflamed with the loue of God. In the Church, the faithfull ſoule talketh with God; there he is praied vnto; and in that place he is honored. In the Church, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:181136:175"/>are preſent; becauſe there is the heauenly court; yea, the very ſame God is there: really and perſonally; and hath promiſed to be there vntill the end of the world.</p>
               <p>In all theſe things you may ſee, how much our Churches be more worthy then the Temple of <hi>Salomon.</hi> So then, if that Temple be ſo much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed by men, and God alſo; it is conuenient, and moſt iuſt, ſeing that our Churches be in ſo high manner honored with the preſence of God himſelf, that they be alſo honored, and reuerenced by vs, and that therein, nothing may be ſaid or done vnſeemely, or vnfitting of ſo worthie a place. Let preſumptuous people, and the prophaners of Churches, feare the like ſeuere punishment, as God gaue to that wretched king <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who prophaned the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>

               <p>We read in auncient hiſtories, that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great was victorious in all his enterpriſes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, before he did prophane the Temple of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> but after that time he was vnfortunate in all
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:181136:176"/>his buſineſſes, and finally, he was vanquished in battaile by <hi>Iulius Caeſar;</hi> and eſcaping by flight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired for aide to the king of <hi>Egipt,</hi> as to his friend but in ſteed of help, he found his death: the king cutting of his head, and ſending it vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the conquerour, as a preſent.</p>
               <p>For prophaners of Churches, and holie places, theſe two examples are ſufficient: and for thoſe that vſe ſmall, or no reuerence to Churches this one is inough: That our Lord and Sauiour himſelf, chaſtiſed them with rigour, which caryed not due reſpect vnto the Temple of <hi>Salomon.</hi> For he himſelf in perſon (when as man he conuerſed with men) did driue the people our of the ſame Temple, with whippes and ſcourges, becauſe they vſed to and in the ſame, ſmalle, or no reuerence Let them, who prophane our Churches (being of farre more excellency then that was) imagine, yea, aſſure themſelues, that they shalbe chaſtiſed with much more rigour.</p>

And in the one, and the other of the theſe things, there was done vnto our Lord God, great, and good ſeruice. The life of this glorious martyr, is taken out of an homilie, or ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, made by</hi> S. Gregorie Niſſen, <hi>which he preached on the daie of his martyrdome, in the ſame Church, where he was buried. He reherſeth it in this wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE cauſe (good Chriſtian people) why you be here aſſembled from diuers partes, with trauaile, and toile of your perſons, by reaſon of the sharpnes of the winter, is onlie to celebrate the feaſt of the glorious martyr S. <hi>Theodore.</hi> This is a thing iuſt and reaſonable, ſince we be all obliged vnto him, for the great and many benefitts, which we haue receaued by his interceſſion. One of theſe
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:181136:177"/>is well knowne vnto all, namely; how the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Scithians this laſt yeere threatening to kill vs, and hauing drawne their ſwordes to bathe them in our blood, returned back vnto their countries in manner of flight; not for feare of our corporall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, but being terrified with the Croſſe of CHRIST; with which, this glorious ſaint, our patrone chaſed the away. I deſire you all to be attentiue, and I will reherſe in what manner this holie martyr ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to giue his life for CHRIST, whileſt he liued in this world: for I do not know in perticuler, the reward he hath in heauen. And when we know this, we ought to take profitt, by endeauouring to imitate him.</p>
               <p>I ſaie then, that we haue his bleſſed body in this Church: and although it be of the ſame matter and nature, that other dead bodies be, yet it is not to be likened vnto them; for if you open any of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers, the bodies appeere lotheſome to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght, and be diſpleaſing to the ſmell; ſo that we tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne our face from them, conſidering the miſerie of our nature, and the frailtie of mankind.</p>
               <p>But vnto this glorious martyr it falleth out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. For aſſoone as we enter into the Church, where his bleſſed bodie is, (as all we haue done this daye) the ſight is pleaſed, ſeing the ſumptuous, and cunning built Church, where it ſeemeth the caruer and the painter contended to excell each other: the one, in the building of the ſame, aſwell in the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as pillers of the fineſt marble (in which be engrauen ſondrie pictures of lyuing creatures) as in the rooffe, and couering of tymber, which is curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie wrought, and cunningly ioyned. The painter
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:181136:177"/>was not inferioure in his art, ſetting forth liuely on the walles, the heroycall acts of this glorious martyr. On the one ſide are the tyrants, with their ſterne, and fell lookes, on the other ſide, the flame, and fire of his martyrdome; the holy ſaint keeping alwaies a mild, and quier countenance. Theſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and pictures ſerue vs in ſtead of bookes: becauſe without ſpeech, they continuallie publish, and she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we vnto vs, the worthy deedes of this glorious martyr. For it is the property of a picture by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to ſpeak; &amp; being painted on the walle, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs in ſtead of a lecture in the ſchoole.</p>
               <p>If one hath entred into the Church, and enjoyed the ſight of theſe things, and yet being deſirous to go further; if he approch vnto the ſepulchre of the holie ſaint, and touch it with his hands, it ſeemeth a holie, and deuout work. But if he be worthie to haue the ſepulchre opened, and that he may ſee the holie bodie there incloſed; O what great content, hath he! for that there was neuer meadowe decked with odoriferous flowers, that gaue a better ſmell, or would be more pleaſing to the ſight then this. He that is thereof worthy forth with approcheth, his eyes fixed, and his mouth ioyned vnto the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reliques, from which iſſueth no euill ſauour, but a fragrant ſmell. There are shed warme teares, there are powred out inflamed ſobbes, the ſaint is hartely beſought, to make interceſſion for vs vnto the maieſty of God. But it one be worthie, to haue a litle of the earth, into which his bleſſed bodie was conuerted, this is accounted a chief happines. The vſe is, to lay it vpon ſick men, hoping thereby the may recouer their health, as oftentimes they
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:181136:178"/>do. I wishe the faithfull beleeuers to conſider he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof; and withall, whether it be granted vnto the Emperours, and monarks of the world, to haue the worthie honor, and veneration that is done vnto this ſaint. But leauing this, I come vnto the hiſtorie of his life.</p>
               <p>His natiue country was in a part of this region, which looketh toward the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> In that place he was borne, and in that place he was brought vp. but at this preſent, the whole world is his natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: for euery martyr may call himſelf <hi>Natiue,</hi> of what country ſoeuer is vnder the ſunne. This bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſaint was a ſouldier, and ſerued vnder the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derds of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> at ſuch time as they ruled the Empire.</p>
               <p>Theſe Emperours being lodged in that country for the winter time by aduiſe of their captaines; there aroſe a moſt perillous warre, not with the Barbarous nation, but in the ſame army: which was cauſed by a diuelish decree, made by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and put in excecution by the captaines. in which Edict all Chriſtians that refuſed to ſacrifice to the Idolls, were condemned to dye. The bleſſed ſouldier, not now of the Emperour, but of IESVS CHRIST, ſeing the wicked ordinance made, and how cruelly it was executed, shewed not any baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in mind, nor altered not his countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, (thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh he knew for certaine, that he was accounted by all men for a Chriſtian) but ſaid boldlie: that this decree was deteſtable, and that he ment not to obey it, though he loſt this life for the ſame. Theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des came vnto the eares of the Coronell, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto him the captaine, and euen as <hi>Herod</hi> and

               <p>Cauſing him to be brought before them, with roughe wordes, and ſterne countenance they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of him; how he durſt be ſo arrogantlie bold, as to deſpiſe this lawe of the Emperours, and to ſaie that he would not obey it? <hi>s. Theodore</hi> with a conſtant, and cheerfull countenance ſaid: I do not diſobey the Emperour, when he commaundeth things that be iuſt and reaſonable, and wherein he is to be obeyed: but when he commaundeth me to adore for Gods, thoſe which be none, and which I do not acknowledg for ſuch, I ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not to obey him. I confeſſe IESVS CHRIST to be God, the only begotten ſonne of his father, conſubſtantiall with the holie Ghoſt, who is likewiſe God, and yet not three Gods, but one God, whoſe faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion I profeſſe. If this ſeeme to be euill vnto you, heere am I ready &amp; offer my ſelf. Let the hangman come and cut of my head, let fire come and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me me, and let him that is offended at my wordes, cut our my toung. I am reſolued, and my bodie is heere ready, patiently to ſuffer any torment what ſoeuer, in any part, or in euery member thereof, for the loue of his creator, and maker. The two vniuſt iudges hearing the couragious reſolution of the yong man, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded, ſtudying what anſwere to make him.</p>
               <p>A certaine ſouldier of that company, who was accounted diſcreet, &amp; wiſe, preſenting himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſaid vnto him: ô <hi>Theodore,</hi> if the God
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:181136:179"/>whom thou adoreſt haue a ſonne as thou ſaiſt, tell me; whether he hath begotten him after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men; who ſeek out ſolitarie and obſcure places, as being loth to be ſeene, in ſo baſe, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefull an acte? <hi>S. Theodore</hi> anſwered: my God fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no shame in the generation of his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonne, but it is a heauenly generation, conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient vnto God onlie, and ſo I do beleeue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence it. But do thou (which ſeemeſt to be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and conſiderate man) tell me, doeſt thou not hold and repute it, for great reproch and infamy, to adore for God, a woman (as your <hi>Cibele</hi> mother of the Gods) who after the manner of a shee wolfe, from tyme to tyme, is great with child, and bringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th forth children? At this queſtion of S. <hi>Theodore,</hi> not onlie that ſawcy fellow was put to ſilence, but alſo the iudges caſt their eyes to the ground; noting well the ſubſtantiall reaſon of the yongman, and how vnfit it was, to adore for a Goddeſſe, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was alwaies, either with child, or els that was deliuered of child. Afterward, ſtudying what to do with S. <hi>Theodore,</hi> they determined to let him go at liberty, and they gaue him time, wherein he should be better aduiſed what he would doe. It may be (ſaid they among themſelues) that when he hath thought better on it, he will leaue his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish opinion, and obey our Emperours. Theſe men called the wiſedome of the yongman folly, as they which be ſtark dronk, vſe to call them dronck, which be ſober, and moſt free from that diſtemper. The time, which was aſſigned vnto S. <hi>Thedore</hi> to aduiſe, and deliberate, he conuerted to the effecting of a renowned deed, which was this.</p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:181136:179"/>
               <p>There was in <hi>Amaſia,</hi> the chief cittie of that prouince, a Temple, dedicated vnto <hi>Cybele</hi> mother of the Gods; which Temple was neere vnto a ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that ran by the citty. S. <hi>Theodore</hi> determining to burne it to the ground, for the better performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, expected a wind, that should driue the flame: and ſo ſetting fire vnto it, the Temple, and all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein contained, was conſumed to ashes. By this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall deed, he gaue anſwere of his determination, in the time that was giuen him for aduiſe. Great was the vproare and tumult that the pagans made, ſearching for the kindler of the fire, entending to punish him, with the greateſt torments that might be imagined. There was no great difficulty in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, for S. <hi>Theodore</hi> himſelf confeſſed that he had done it, and in his words and countenance, he shewed himſelf to be well pleaſed with the act, and the rather, for that an Idoll of the ſame Goddeſſe had bene burned therein. This on the other ſide was as diſpeaſing to the paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, who held that Idoll in high eſtimation.</p>
               <p>They took S. <hi>Theodore,</hi> and haled him vnto iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, howling and yelling generally, as if they had bene beaſtes, or out of their wittes. The iudges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of them; if he had kindled that fire? The holie ſaint forthwith confeſſed; that he had done it, and willed them to make readie torments, for he was prepared to endure them. The deſire, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes which the iudges beheld in <hi>S. Theodore</hi> to ſuffer torments, made them haue the leſſe will to torture him, wishing to themſelues the like cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious ſtomake, as the yongman had. Wherevpon, without regard of the complaints, &amp; exclamations
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:181136:180"/>of the common people, who (fearing their Gods would chaſtice them all, for this treſpaſſe that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> had committed againſt them) beſought them with great inſtancy to put him to death.</p>
               <p>In this rage and furie of the people, the iudges ſaid to S. <hi>Theodore:</hi> notwith ſtanding thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued death, yet we will pardon thee, and make thee high prieſt of the Idolls, if thou wilt ſacrifiſe vnto them, and leaue and relinquish the name of a Chriſtian. The bleſſed youngma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deriding them ſaid: In deed you promiſe me great preferment, and that which may mooue a man to follow your counſell. For the prieſtes of your Idolls, I hold them to be accurſed wretches, and if I be made chief of them, I shalbe made the moſt accurſed wretch of them all. Long ſince haue I laughed at this folly and madnes of many great men; that ſometimes the Conſulls, yea the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelues, would take the office of the high prieſt (which you promiſe vnto me) vnder a shew of religion, and they which were firſt clothed in purple, were clad after in the habite of fooles or madmen. And many times they cut in pieces liuing beaſtes for their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, putting ſome part thereof to ſeethe, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to be conſumed with fire. Such a blindnes is not committed, but by them that be blind, as they bee, ſince by leauing the adoration of the God of heauen, they adore Gods made of wood, ſtones, and mettall.</p>
               <p>The Iudges hearing the reaſons, perceiued they loſt their time, and could not preuaile with <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore:</hi> wherefore they called him a ſacrilegious, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, and wicked villaine, and commaunded
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:181136:180"/>he should be tormented. They bound him vnto a poſt and whipped him, then rent they his flesh wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th crooks of Iron, and put burning torches vnto his ſides. The more dillige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the execucioners were to torture him, ſo much the more cheerfully the bleſſed martyr (as if he had bene in a pleaſant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) ſong this verſe of <hi>Dauid: I will alwaies bleſſe our Lord, his praiſes shall euer be in my mouth.</hi> When the cruell officers were tyred, they took him from the poſt, and caſt him into a dark dongeon, in the which were heard all that night voyces, which ſong ſweetly, and the roome was filled with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable brightnes, and thoſe that were without were partakers hereof.</p>
               <p>When the keeper of the priſon perceiued it, he called ſome companie vnto him, and went into the place where S. <hi>Theodore</hi> was, finding no more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there, but the holie ſaint, &amp; the reſt that were priſoners as he was, who were all a ſleep. The next daie they tormented him againe, and ſeing him fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and conſtant in his faith, they gaue ſentence that he should be burned, and the iudgment was put in execution. As the holie ſaint ſtood in the fire, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and glorifying God, the fire indeed took his life away, but ſpared his bodie, for it did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, nor ſcorch one haire of his head. Wherefore a religious woman called <hi>Euſebia,</hi> wrapped it in a cleane sheet, and enterred it, that we might enioy this pretious treaſure, which hath cauſed this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of people, to honor him, and celebrate this daie of his tryumph, where euery one is holpen for his ſake. Out of this man he caſteth diuells, another he deliuereth from infirmities, vnto others he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:181136:181"/>the infirmities of the bodie, vnto others the neceſſities of the ſoule. There thoſe that be toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the tempeſts of the world, find a ſafe port, &amp; ſecure hauen. There the Orphants find a father, the pilgrins an Inne, the afflicted a comforter, and help for them that are in neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>O thou holie ſaint, and glorious martyr <hi>Theodore,</hi> that art among the quiers of Angells, vouchſafe to go vnto the preſence of God, and praie before the throne of his maieſtie for vs, that be in this place aſſembled, to celebrate the tryumph of thy bleſſed martyrdome. Encline to vs that call vpon thee, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor thee, and be preſent at the ſollemnity of thy feaſt. And though our corporall eyes cannot ſee thee; yet caſt downe thine eyes vnto our ſacrifiſes, and bowe thine eares vnto our prayers. make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hereof we beſeech thee vnto the maieſtie of God, deſiring him to harken vnto vs, and to heare thee, that vnto him may be recommended, thy country, which is alſo ours, thy brethren, kinsfolk, friends, and they, that vnto thee be religiouſly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who be here preſent: and that he would defend vs from all our enemies in generall, and in eſpeciall, from theſe barbarous Scithians. Thou as a valiant ſouldier fight for vs, as a holie martyr praie for vs. Obtaine for vs a perpetuall peace, that we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our ſelues, in the ſeruice of him, whom thou ſerueſt.</p>
               <p>And if perhaps there needeth greater help, ſpeak vnto thy brethren to acompany thee. Call vnto <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> head of the Church, ſpeak vnto <hi>Paul</hi> doctor of the Gentiles, and vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloued, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous diuine; that the Churches, which theſe men
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:181136:181"/>haue founded, and the ſoules whom they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, may remaine conſtant, in the holie and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, which they once receiued. That they may be alſo freed from heretiks and hereſies, from tyrants and their tyrany; and by confeſſing IESVS CHRIST boldly, and faithfully ſeruing him, they may afterwards poſeſſe and enioye him eternally, being partakers of his grace in this world, and of his glorie in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>The holie Church maketh commemoration of S. <hi>Theodore,</hi> on the daie of his martyrdome, which was on the 9. of <hi>Nouember,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord 300. <hi>Diocletian,</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> being Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.

The manner hereof, as it is extant in diners martyrologes, was in this ſort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Trypho</hi> was borne in <hi>Rome,</hi> in a ſtreet called <hi>Saxea.</hi> He being verie yong, exerciſed himſelf in good and holie works, and God by his meanes did ſome miracles, by healing perſons po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the diuell, and grieued with other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. In that sharp perſecution of <hi>Decius,</hi> this holie ſaint showed himſelf zealous of the honor of God, by preaching IESVS CHRIST publiklie; without fearing the Edicts of the Emperour, or the cruelty that his officers vſed againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. He encouraged the feeble, and animated the faintharted, not to dread the torments which should quickly end, and were meanes to attaine perpetuall ioye in heauen.</p>
               <p>A gouernour called <hi>Quilinus,</hi> being certified he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, and finding it to be very true, for that <hi>S. Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho</hi>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:181136:182"/>himſelf confeſſed the ſame, he commaunded he should be tormented. The firſt was the ordinary torment, that was: to tye him vnto the <hi>Equuleus,</hi> where his bodie being racked, it was rent and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne with hooks of Iron. Then ſet they burning tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vnto his ſides, and gaue him many blowes with kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted ſtaues; and laſtlie, his feet were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through, with hot burning nayles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Trypho</hi> tollerated all this with a couragious mind, and a cheerefull countenance, ſo that a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune called <hi>Respicius</hi> ſeing it, conſidered thus: That a man of flesh and blood, could not haue ſuch ſtrength, nor tollerate ſo great, and ſo many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if he were not aſiſted, and holpen by God: And if God did help him, it was certaine, that he was very high in his fauour: Whereupon, it might be truly gathered, that the God whom this holie man confeſſed, and for whoſe ſake he endured ſo many torments, and by whom he was ſo much hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, was the true God; and that all the other were falſe Gods.</p>
               <p>In the time that <hi>Respicius</hi> ſtood in theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, there came to him a gracious dewe from heauen, vnto which he made no reſiſtance, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly confeſſed, that he was a Chriſtian, When the officers that tormented S. <hi>Trypho</hi> heard this, they layd hands on him, and began to torment them both together. Then did they lead them into the Temple, vnto the ſtatue of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and <hi>S.

               <p>There he was enſtructed in learnyng, and good behauiour.

               <p>On a time as he entred the city of <hi>Amiens,</hi> which is in <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> he ſaw a poore man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that craued almes of them that paſſed by. It was winter, and extreame cold: S. <hi>Martin</hi> was at that time armed, and had no other garment, but his ſouldiers coate. The holy ſaint ſeeing no man to beſtowe any thing on the poore man, cut his cote in two parts with his ſword, and gaue one halfe therof to the poore man, and the other part he reſerued for himſelf. Many ſaw this deed; and ſome laughed to ſee him with half a garment; and others were ashamed, to conſider they had not done the like charitable deed in all their life; and better might they haue done it, ſince they might haue clothed the poore man, and not haue vnclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed themſelfs.</p>
               <p>The next night, S. <hi>Martin</hi> being in a ſound ſleep he ſaw (in a viſion) CHRIST couered with the piece of the garment he had giuen vnto the poore man, and drawing nere vnto him; asked if he knew that garment? Then he heard CHRIST ſay to his Angells, <hi>Martin</hi> being yet a <hi>Catechumen,</hi> hath couered me with this garment. By this doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare that which IESVS CHRIST ſaid in the ghoſpell: <hi>That which is done vnto the poore, is done vnto me.</hi> S. <hi>Martin</hi> was not proud of this, but yelded thanks vnto CHRIST for it, and was very earneſt
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:181136:185"/>and diligent to obteine Baptiſme. and deſired to leaue the ſeruice of the warres; but at the entreaty and importunacy of his Coronell, he ſtaied vntill his time was expired. He was Baptiſed at the age of. 18. yeares, and remained ſtill a ſouldier for the ſpace of two years, after which time he lefte the warres by reaſon of a peace enſuing, which ſeemed to be miraculous, and was thus.</p>
               <p>The armies being ready to ioine battell, a peace was made, vpon very honorable condicions, for the ſide, wheron S. <hi>Martin</hi> was: yea it is thought, that almightie God made it, for his holy ſaints ſake, who being abuſed in words by his captaine, who called him coward, and baſe fellow, ſaying alſo, that he deſired to leaue the ſouldiers life, that he might not be indangered in that battell; <hi>S. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> offered to paſſe through the enemies ſquadrons with out any armor; for which cauſe God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue him from that iminent daunger, procured an honorable peace to be made for his ſide.</p>
               <p>Then went S. <hi>Martin</hi> to <hi>S. Hillary</hi> Bishop of <hi>Poiters,</hi> with whom he remained ſome certeine da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes enioying his holy company, and was edified by his vertuous behauior. Then deſirous to returne into his owne countrey, he tooke leaue of <hi>S. Hillary</hi> both of them weeping aboundantly at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at which time <hi>S. Hillary</hi> gaue vnto <hi>S. Martin</hi> the order of <hi>Acolite,</hi> &amp; beſought him to retorne back vnto him ſpeedely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Martin</hi> trauelling on the way was like to haue bene murdered, for certain thieues lying in waite for him, one of them ſtriking a full blow with his ſword to wound him, and another bearing it of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:181136:185"/>with his weapon, <hi>S. Martin</hi> shewed no feare at all. And being demaunded the cauſe, he made aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: I neuer had leſſe feare in my life, for that I ſerue a Lord, who (I am aſſuered) will not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me in a greater daunger, then this is. Herof the holy ſaint tooke occaſion, to preach vnto them IESVS CHRIST: and one of thoſe thiefs was conuerted, and entred into relligion, and died a bleſſed man.</p>
               <p>At laſt he came to his owne countrey and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the faith of CHRIST vnto his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His mother was conuerted, but his father continued ſtill in his Idollatry, and after that, many other perſons were conuerted to the faith, by his meanes.</p>
               <p>At that time the Arrian hereſy was ſpred very much in the countrey, where <hi>S. Martin</hi> preached: and becauſe he only publikely reſiſted them, the heretiks did perſecute him with all extremity, and on a time they impriſoned him, and ſcourged him publikely, (ſo shameleſſe they were,) and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent herewith, they ſent him into exile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Martin</hi> departing from his natiue countrey, returned into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and there he vnderſtood, that <hi>S. Hillary</hi> was alſo banished by the Arrians, wherfore he paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> and builded a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery nere vnto <hi>Millan,</hi> where ſome Catholiques aſſembling together, liued iointly with him a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall life. But he was there alſo greuouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, by a principall Arrian heretique, called <hi>Auxentius,</hi> who after he had done him many wrongs and abuſes, neuer ceaſed, vntill he had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him from thence alſo.</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:181136:186"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Martin</hi> yealding to the time, took ſea, and came to an Iſland called <hi>Gallinaria,</hi> in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of a holy prieſt: where they two remained a good ſpace, ſuſteining themſelfs with the rootes of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes only. Then newes came vnto him, that <hi>S. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> was returned vnto his Bishoprique. wherefore he determined to find him out, and when he came thither, the holy father receiued him very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Martin</hi> dwelling there, built another mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery nere vnto <hi>Poiters,</hi> vnto which place came a <hi>Catechumen,</hi> to be inſtructed in the faith and holy behauior. It happened that S. <hi>Martin</hi> being abſent, the yong man fell ſicke, and died; and whileſt the other relligious men prepared to bury him, the holy ſaint came, and made great shew of ſorowe, for the death of that his diſciple, and coming into the roome, where the dead body lay, he bad all the other depart out: then he shutt the dore, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there two houres in praiers; and he that was dead began then by litle and litle to recouer his ſences, and returned to life, and perfect health. When theother relligious men ſawe it, they gaue vnto God infinite thanks; and the yong man that had taſted of death, was baptiſed, and liued many yeares after. S. <hi>Martin</hi> raiſed to life another dead man, who had hanged himſelf (as it was thought) vpon a melancholick humor predominant in him, depriuing him of his vnderſtanding: but by the praier of S. <hi>Martin</hi> he recouered, and was reſtored to his life and health alſo.</p>
               <p>The fame of this holy ſaint was ſpread very farre wherwith the citizens of <hi>Towers</hi> being moued,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:181136:186"/>ſought meanes to haue him to their Bishop, but it was a hard matter, to get him out of his monaſtery. They that went for him, vſed this wile, to get him away: Aman that loued the monaſtery, told him his wife was ſicke in <hi>Poiters,</hi> and deſired him to goe thither, to viſite and heale her. S. <hi>Martin</hi> vpon this occaſion departed from the monaſtery, and the meſſagers of the city of <hi>Towers,</hi> carried him away by force, before the monks (who had laboured to hinder his departure) perceiued it. S. <hi>Martin</hi> was receiued in <hi>Towers</hi> with great ioy, by all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who ſaid all with one voice; They were now happie, ſince they had to their father and paſtour, ſo holy and humble a man.</p>
               <p>After he was made Bishop, though he changed his eſtate, yet he altred not his life, for he was as lowely, and was appareilled as meanely as he was before time. He diſcharged his office and duety to the full: for he was very diligent, in procuring the good of his flock, and in repelling all euill from them. He reproued vice, commended vertue: he preached, he punished, he rewarded, and did not omitt any thing, that was couenient and fit to be done; ſo that thereby he diſcharged fully his duety toward his neighboure. To diſcharge his duety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God he cauſed a monaſtery to be built vpon a craggy mounteine, two miles from the city, to which place were aſſembled many relligious men, and there he had a cell, into which he withdrew himſelf oftentimes, to pray, and to liue in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
               <p>The relligious men who aroſe in short ſpace to the nomber of 80. moued by the example of S.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:181136:187"/>
                  <hi>Martin</hi> liued a holy life, in chaſtity, pouerty, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and continuall faſting and prayer, and their habites were made of camells hayre. Their diet was very temperate, none dronk wyne, except he was ſick, and they went very ſeldome out of their cells. S. <hi>Martin</hi> had ſome of theſe monks always in his company; and when he ſtayed any time in the monaſtery, and returned into the city, they that were poſeſſed of the deuill gaue notice therof, by the feare and dread they shewed, and by the paine they ſuffered before he entred the towne, and this befell, into what city ſo euer he came.</p>
               <p>This holy prelate vſed great dilligence, in the extirpation of Idollatry out of his dioceſſe, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled into many places, throwing to the ground the Idolls of the Gentills, cutting downe, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng the groues and trees, wherin the deuills gaue oracles and aunſwers, for which cauſe he was oftentimes in daunger to be murdered by the common people, but his deportment and cariage was ſo diſcreet in all his affaires, accompanied with ſome myracle, in the ſight of them that were agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at his doings, that ſometimes whole compai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fell at his feet, and beſought him, they might be made Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>It would be a long ſtory to recount, how many ſicke he healed by his prayers: but among others, one was <hi>Paulinus,</hi> ouer whoſe eyes was growne ſuch a webbe that it made him blind, and alſo put him to much paine. The holy ſaint did clenſe them one time with a napkin, and he was made whole, his ſight reſtored, and his grief ceaſed.</p>
               <p>After this S. <hi>Martin</hi> (being Bishop) raiſed to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:181136:187"/>life the ſonne of a diſtreſſed poore mother, whofin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him in the city of <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tres</hi> in the company of many Idollaters, layd before him her dead ſonne, and requeſted him very earneſtly to raiſe him vnto life. The holy ſaint made his prayer for him, and he reuiued. This myracle cauſed many of thoſe pagans to come to the faith of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Martin</hi> (after he was Bishop) raiſed to life none but this child; and bycauſe he had raiſed vnto life two before that, he vſed to ſay vnto his diſciples and friends; that he was better by two parts, before he was Bishop, then after, and that his high dignity had diminished his vertue. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant the holy man ſaid theſe words for lowlines and humility: for it is well known, that after he was Bishop, he did many admirable and vertuous deeds, which he had not done in the former time. But this declareth and sheweth his charity, and humility.</p>
               <p>He was Bishop when he came into <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſawe at the gate a leprous man ſoe full of ſoies and blaines, that the only ſight of him was gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and importable to many; the good prelate came cloſe to him, and embraced him, and layd his face on the face of the leper, he kiſſed him very charitably, &amp; there with cuted him, and made him whole. This leper (whom the whole city had ſeene) came the day following to the Church, and gaue thanks publiquely vnto God, for the recouery of his health.</p>
               <p>He was Bishop when <hi>Sulpitius</hi> who wrote his life viſited him: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he receiued moſt kindly, and gaue him harty thankes that he was come from <hi>Toloſe</hi> to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:181136:188"/>
                  <hi>Towers,</hi> only to ſee him. The bleſſed man himſelf washed his feet, made him ſitt at his table, at the which he filled more his ſoule, then his body, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his words, enkindled with the fier of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall loue, and the grauity of his reaſons. This Autor ſaid: I neuer ſawe, nor conuerſed with any mortall man furnished with ſuch ſcience, witte, and eloquence, &amp; ſuch aboundance of pure &amp; chaſt words, as I found in <hi>Martin:</hi> &amp; it made me more to marueile, for that I know he was vnlettered. The ſomme of his ſpeaches, were of the contempt of the world; to auoid vice; to loue vertue; and that which he ſaid, he performed alſo in deed. Noe tounge is able to expreſſe that, which I noted to be in this holy ſaint, in the time I liued in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: I neuer ſawe him angry; I neuer ſawe him diſpleaſed or diſcontent; much leſſe to laugh after a diſſolute maner: and this was, becauſe that what ſo euer befell, he receiued it, as ſent from God.</p>
               <p>The auſterityes of his faſtings, watching, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall wearing of ſackcloth, were things rather to be admyred, then imitated. He ſlept continually on the ground: he vſed to eate, and ſleep ſo litle, that it ſeemed impoſſible he could liue with it. He was neuer idle; when he had diſpatched the affaires and buſines of his Church, he ſpent the reſt of his time in reading the holy ſcripture, mixing it with praier. Herin he did as the ſmithes doe, ſtriking vpon the hotte iron, who that they may continue the better, giue now and then an idle blow: euen ſo did S. <hi>Martin,</hi> as for a recreation, praying one while, and reading another. O bleſſed man, in whom was found no guile nor double dealing! he neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:181136:188"/>ne iudged any; he neuer rendered euill for euill.</p>
               <p>When he was Bishop, he would reproue men for their offences againſt God, and chaſtiſe them for aggreuances done againſt their neighbour; but he neuer reproued nor chaſtiſed any offence or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greuance done againſt himſelf. In his mouth you should haue alwaies the holy name of IESVS: in his hart was nothing but piety and mercy; and he would perſuade all to make much of that vertue. He gaue an eſpeciall charge vnto his monks to be obedient; ſaying be obedyent vnto man for the loue of God; ſince the ſame God would be obedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto man, for the good of all mankind.</p>
               <p>He vſed ſom-times, to ſpeak ſome pleaſant words, by which might be taken ſome ghoſtly profit for the ſoule; as he did one time, when he ſawe a sheep newely shorne. This litle beaſt (ſaid he) hath performed the Euangelicall precept: for shee hauing two garments, hath giuen one to them, that had none; and ſo we ought to doe. And this the bleſſed ſaint performed alſo not long after: for being ready one day to ſay maſſe, a poore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man asked an almes of him. The bleſſed Bishop comaunded the Archdeacon to buy a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the pooreman: but the Archdeacon, who had in charg to giue many almes, was ſlacke, and loth to giue it; whervpon the poore man got vp into the veſtry, where S. <hi>Martin</hi> was, and told him; that the garment was not giuen him, as he had bidden.</p>
               <p>The holy ſaint forth with pulled of his owne gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; gaue it to the poore man. The Archdeacon
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:181136:189"/>came in then, and told him; that the people ſtayed to heare maſſe, and thought him long; the bleſſed man anſwered; he could not come out, vntill the poore man had his garment giuen him. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon replyed; the poore man is gone, I knowe not whither, and S. <hi>Martin</hi> ſaid: Bring (I ſay) the garment, we shall find a poore man to receaue it. The Archdeacon went out in a chaſe, and bought a courſe garment, and of a ſmall price, and caſt it before the ſaint on the ground. He tooke it vp, and put it on, and then he reueſted himſelf to ſay maſſe.</p>
               <p>When he held up the B. ſacrament at the eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his armes were left bare, for that the ſleeues of the coat were ſo short, and the ſleeues of the Albe were too wide. Some that were in the Church, ſawe the Angells to couer his armes with plates of gold, which shined very bright. It is ſaid; that herof cometh the vſe, that ouer the prieſtly garment called the Albe, they put the maniples of ſilke, or ſome fine ſtuffe, finer then the Albe is; but all men vſe it not ſo, nor in all countries: for it was ſo ordeined by ſome particuler Churches, but not by the pope in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Angells did diſcend vnto the place where S. <hi>Martin</hi> was, yea one day two of his diſciples heard him talk in his cell, and knowing that none went in, but himſelf they entreated him to tell them, with whom he talked; and being importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by them, he ſaid: I will, vpon condition, that you shall not ſpeak of it to any man, as long as I liue. Know you, that there was the mother of God, and with her S. <hi>Agnes</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Tecla;</hi> and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared marks of the countenaunces of our Lady,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:181136:189"/>and the other two ſaints. moreouer he told them, that ſometimes S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> had talked with him. This holy ſaint was ſlowe in reſoluyng and determyning of any waighty matter.</p>
               <p>On a time the deuill reproued him, for that he receaued them that committed heynous ſinnes vnto penance, and among others them, that denyed the faith, ſaying; that God would not pardon them. When S. <hi>Martin</hi> heard theſe words, he ſaid with a loud voice. If thou (miſerable wretch) hadſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe for thy ſinne, and done due penance, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God is ſo great, that I would obteine pardon of God for thee alſo. Well, the ſanctity of this good prelat, was diuulged euery day more and more.</p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Maximus</hi> ruled the <hi>Weſt</hi> Empire, which he had vſurped vpon two Emperours, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>Gratian</hi> the one, and putting <hi>Valentinian</hi> the other vnto shamefull flight: who fled vnto th'emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> who gouerned th'empire in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> This <hi>Theodoſius</hi> shortly after returned the ſame meaſure vnto <hi>Maximus,</hi> as he had done vnto <hi>Gratian,</hi> for he depriued him of his life and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both at a time, &amp; reſtored it vnto <hi>Valentinian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Maximus</hi> had maryed a noble Lady who was a good Chriſtian, and had a ſpeciall affection vnto <hi>S. Martin.</hi> She perſuaded her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (keping their court in <hi>Fraunce</hi>) to ſend for S. <hi>Martin</hi> to come vnto them. <hi>Maximus,</hi> (though he was a tirant) did ſo: not ſo much for the loue of his wife, as for to ſee S. <hi>Martin,</hi> of whom he had heard great reports, and vnto whom he bare good affection. It cannot be expreſſed, how ioyfully the holy ſaint was entertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eſpecially by the empreſſe, who appointed
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:181136:190"/>lodgings for him within her Royall court, where the good prelat treated with the Empereſſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny important matters, aſwell bodily as ghoſtly; and shee ſtood at his feete, like as <hi>Magdallene</hi> did before the feet of CHRIST, washing them with her teares.</p>
               <p>The good empreſſe forgot her eſtate, her riches, her pompe, and her ſelf alſo; yea shee was beſide herſelf, when she was in contemplation of that holy ſaint. And he that in his life for the ſpace of 60. years, had neuer permitted any woman to come neere him, could not forbid the empreſſe to touch, and to kiſſe his feer: Shee alſo by her many teares obreined of th'em perour and of <hi>S Martin,</hi> to dine together at one table, without any other atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dants, but her ſelf in perſon.</p>
               <p>When dynner time came, it was a memorable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to ſee the dillingence, the Empres vſed to ſerue the holy man. She couered and furnished the table for him: shee placed the ſtooles: gaue him water for his hands: and then ſet on the meat, which shee had dreſſed her ſelf for him. Whileſt the holy ſaint did eare, shee was careful, that nothing should be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. With her owne hands shee powred the wine into the cuppe, when shee gaue him drinke. And when the holy ſaint had done eating, shee voyded the table, gathered vp the meate that remained, which afterward shee eate, thinking it to be more ſauory, then if it had bene after the moſt royall maner shee had vſed before time.</p>
               <p>Another time th'emperour inuited S. <hi>Martin,</hi> and made him ſet at the table, and apointed at reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious prieſt, that came with him, to ſit by him, and many great Lords were ſett therat alſo. When the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:181136:190"/>holy ſaint asked for drink, the Emperour bade his cuppe should be caryed vnto him, thinking, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had drunk, he would haue reſtored it vnto th'emperour: but <hi>S. Martin</hi> did not ſo, but gaue in to the prieſt that ſatt by him; gyuing them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he was of more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, then th'empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by reaſon of pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtly functió. And that which others would haue raken as a reproach, th'empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and all they that were at the table commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Th'emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> the ſecond, being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto th'empire after the death of <hi>Maximus</hi> who put him to flight, did not behaue himſelf ſo. for 5. <hi>Martin</hi> commyng one day to viſite th'emperour, who had a wife infected with the hereſy of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and therfore an ennemy vnto S. <hi>Martin,</hi> shee reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted th'emperour not to doe him any honour, and he yeelded ro her deſire. The bleſled prelate came into the roome, where th'emperour was, who ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not from his ſeat. The holy ſaint came neerer vnto him; yet th'emperour ſtirred not, nor made any ſigne of kindnes or curteſy. It was ſurely the will of God, that the ſeat where th'emperour ſat, fell a fier of it ſelf, and burned and flamed out. When <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> felt the fier, he roſe in haſt and ſtumbled, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing already burned his clothes, and ſcorched his skinne; and conſidering what the cauſe was, he went toward S. <hi>Martin,</hi> and did vnto him very great reuerence, and before the holy ſaint ſayd any thing, graunted vnto him, what ſoeuer he came to demaunde.</p>
               <p>Another time S. <hi>Martin</hi> went to viſit a holy da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell; and it is good to make memory of her, for
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:181136:191"/>the example of others, to the end, the may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, that (if they shutt their gates againſt apparant wicked men) they should not always open their dores vnto them, that ſeme to be good. There was in a litle village a damoſell, who hued ſecret and priuat, whoſe good report was diuulged thorough the chiefeſt cities of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> aſwell for her beauty, as for her verruous liuers, ſo that their houſe ſeemed to be a monaſtery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Martin</hi> being told of her, was deſirous to ſee, if the report made was true. and though he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from the conuerſation and viſiting of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet one day paſſing neere vnto the village, he deſired to ſee that yong woman. All the people (as the vſe was in all places where the holy man went) came out to meet him, as if he had bene one of the Apoſtles, ſo much they reioiced to ſee him.</p>
               <p>The holy ſaint turned out of the way, to go to the houſe of that vertuous damoſell; who being certified that S. <hi>Martin</hi> came to viſit her, and being fully reſolued not to alter her determination, she ſent one of thoſe women, who kept her company, vnto. s. <hi>Martin</hi> to excuſe her, and to alleadg a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why shee came not out to meet him. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man accepted it for very good, &amp; as well done. and praiſed exceedingly the yong woman, and ſaid; that her vertue ſurpaſſed the report that went of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Martin</hi> being gone vnto anot her towne, the damoſell ſent vnto him a preſent, which the holy ſaint receiued with a cheareful countenáce, though
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:181136:191"/>it be not knowne that euer he receiued any guift of any woman but that, in all his life; and when he receiued it he ſaid: it is not fit a prieſt should refuſe the preſent, ſent by a damoſell, that was more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in her life, then many prieſts.</p>
               <p>This good paſtour went ſometimes to viſite his dioceſſe: and at one time (among others) he came vnto a ſamll village. Becauſe it was wynter, they prepared his lodging in the veſtry of the Church, in which place they made him abed, and a fire alſo. They holy ſaint went to reſt yet becauſe he was not vſed to lye but on the ground, the bed was trouble ſome vnto him. And being deſirous to throw the couerlet of him, by chaunce he caſt it on the fire, and perciued it not; at laſt he fell on ſleep, and the couerlet began to burne, and ſet fire on the roome. The flame being now gotten to the toppe of the houſe, S. <hi>Martin</hi> ſtarted vp, and ran to the doore; but he was ſo troubled, that he could not open it. His prieſts and monks were without, in great care and grief, for that they knew not how to help him, or ſaue the houſe. At laſt the holy ſaint determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fall to his prayer, as the generall remedy in all his daungers, and ſo he did: wherby it came to paſſe, that the fier was extinguished, and he was deliuered from all daunger in a moment.</p>
               <p>He was often in daungers by ſondry perſecuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Arryans, who neuer permitted him to be attepoſe or quiet, as appeared in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, in which the holy ſaint was preſent, wherein they outfaced, menaced, adn vſed reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and opprobrious words of him: yet the holy man preuailed, and continued a conſtant and valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:181136:192"/>defender of the Catholique Romane Church, vnto which he was always ſubiect, as an obedyent ſonne ought. This good prelat bare ſuch a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Church, that he was neuer ſeene to ſit therein; but either did kneele or ſtand on his feet, and being asked the cauſe, he ſaid: know you not, that God is preſent in this place?</p>
               <p>Finally, being nowe old, and tired with theſe conflicts with the deuill, and his myniſters (the fiend oftentimes appearing vnto him, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by threats, and other whiles by craft and ſurrlery ſeeking to do him harme) and the time of his death approaching, which he knowing by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, being at <hi>Candacenſe,</hi> (a place in his dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) he aſembled his diſciples together, and certe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, that the hower of his death drew neere. This newes, putting them in great ſorrowe, and grief; they ſaid vnto him: deare father, why wilt thou leaue vs? vnto whom doeſt thou recommend vs? behold the hungry wolfs will aſſaile thy flocke, and there wilbe no meanes to repaire the loſſe, when then shepheard is gone: we knowe, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fireſt to be with CHRIST, and we know alſo, that thy reward remayneth ſure and certein in he auen, and that it is not leſſened, though thou ſtay with vs a litle ſpace. Haue pitty on vs, that shall be left alone, and abandoned.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Martin,</hi> heating theſe words, was moued to pitty and compaſſion, and shedding teares, his eyes fixed alſo toward heauen, ſaid: Lord, if thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue yet need of me, I refufe not the paine and the trauell, but thy will be done: Thus this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous father was diſtracted bettewne loue and hope
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:181136:192"/>and knew not, which to elect. It greued him, to leaue his diſciples: and he was not willing to ſtay any longer, from enioying the preſence of God, vnto whom he remitted all. O man rightly to be called valliant, who was not ouercome by trauell and paine, much leſſe by death! he feared not death and refuſed not to liue.</p>
               <p>His feuer encreaſed, and his diſciples ſeing his end to approach, and that he lay on the earth and ashes, which was his vſuall bed, requeſted him then to permit cherishing and comfort to be done to him. And he aunſwered. A Chriſtian should not dye but on haire cloth and ashes: then it is more fit that I doe ſo, who am your maſter, and prelate, and am therefore obliged and bound to giue you good example.</p>
               <p>Then they requeſted him to turne his head a litle on the one ſide, and not to hold it always vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to looke vpward, being ſo painfull: and he ſaid: Let me look vp toward heauen, ſince that very shortly my ſpirit is to go that way, which I behold. When the agony of death came, he ſaw the deuill (the ennemy of mankind) and ſaid vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His bleſſed ſoule was borne into heauen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with many Angells, who made much ioy, and ſong melodiouſly. This muſique was heard by ſundry perſons, that were in places farre diſtant, as of <hi>seuerinus</hi> Arch B. of <hi>Collein,</hi> and by S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Arch Bishop of <hi>Millan.</hi> Who ſayeng of maſſe, fell
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:181136:193"/>a ſleep, from the which, he awaked after three ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers; and then ſaid to the ſtanders by: know you, that my brother <hi>Martin</hi> B. of <hi>Towers</hi> is departed out of this life, and I haue bene preſent there to bury his body.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Martin</hi> liued on the earth poore and humble: and intred into heauen rich and with great maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. His death was on the. 11. day of <hi>Nouember,</hi> (and on the ſame day, the Church celebrateth his feaſt,) and it was in the year of our Lord. 399. in the time of the Emperour <hi>Honorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This holy ſaint did many myracles in his life time, and alſo after his death: Whileſt he liued, he was the meanes, that many were conuerted vnto God by his good example, and excellent doctrine: and after his death, many were holpen by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and in terceſſion.</p>

               </p>
               <p>IN the ſecond yeare of <hi>Caius Valerius Diocleſianus,</hi> and in the firſt yeare of <hi>Caius Valerius Maximia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> after the death of <hi>Numerianus,</hi> who had gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Empire before them, there was raiſed a ſore perſecution againſt the Chriſtians, through all the lands ſubiect to the Empire. Into which were ſent publike proclamations, conteining the will of the Emperours, and the punishment that should be inflicted vpon thoſe that diſobeied the ſame.</p>
               <p>There was in the cittie of <hi>Cottieum,</hi> which is in the prouince of <hi>Phrigia</hi> (or in <hi>Aſia minor</hi>) a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent calſed <hi>Pirrhus Arginiſcus,</hi> who had the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:181136:194"/>of that prouince, &amp; had alſo authority ouer the men of warre, which were reſident in the ſame, as a garriſon for defence therof. Notwithſtanding, they had a generall captaine ouer them, called <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milianus.</hi> Among the ſouldiers there was one in the regiment of <hi>Rutilus,</hi> called <hi>Menna,</hi> by nation an <hi>Aegiptian,</hi> and by profeſſion a Chriſtian; whoſe vertue shone among the reſt, as the ſunne doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ſtarres. The Emperours edict came vnto this cittie, the tenor whereof was this: <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> Emperours to all their ſubiects se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth greeting Foraſmuch as we acknow ledg, to haue receaued many fauours, and graces of of the ſoueraigne Gods, for which we thinck our ſelues obliged and bound, to procure all honour and ſeruice, to be done vnto them, and their Temples: We therefore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund all magiſtrates, and captaines of our Empire, that aſſoone as they haue notice of this our Edict, that they endeauour with all dilligence (as a thing that concerneth the ſaffetie of our eſtate, &amp; the honor of the Gods our benefactors) that all our ſubiects, aſwell men, as women, of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer they bee, do worship and adore them, and do offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in viſiring often their temples. And thoſe that be diſobedient, and rebellious againſt our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, that they be tormented, in the moſt cruell forte, that may be inuented. This was the tenor of the Edict.</p>
               <p>Aſſoone as the preſident receaued it, he cauſed it to be proclaimed through all the cittie, &amp; other places of his prouince. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding withall, that preſently after the proclamation, all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:181136:194"/>should go vnto the Temples, to the end, the diſobedient perſons might be knowne. In moſt places where the proclamation was made, there were great murmurings amongſt the people, for that it was thought both vniuſt, and cruell; yet the greateſt part of people went (of force) vnto the Temples, to obey the Edict. When the valiant ſouldier ſo <hi>Menna</hi> vnderſtood hereof, he was not able to endure ſo vniuſt, and vnrighteous proceedings; as to haue the veneration and worship of the true GOD IESVS CHRIST to be abolished; and that in ſtead thereof reuerence should be done vnto the fiends. Becauſe he would be free, and not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of this wicked tranſgreſſion, nor ſo much as ſee it, he departed from the armie, and withdrew himſelf into a deſert, where he remained fiue yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, leading a ſollitarie life, in continuall faſting and works of penance, which was as an exerciſe, and an entrance into the warre, and battaile, which he expected shortly to make.</p>
               <p>At the laſt, inſpired by God, he returned into the cittie, vpon a day, which was kept very ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne, as the birthdaie of one of their Godds. The people of the cittie were generally aſſembled into a Theatre, expecting certaine martiall exerciſes, as Iuſts, and turneis. And there was alſo the preſident <hi>Pirrhus</hi> for the ſame purpoſe. S. <hi>Menna</hi> entred into the middeſt of the show, and with a loud and cleere voice he reherſed a text out of the Pophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ca. 65.</note> which ſaith: <hi>I haue bene found of them that ſought me not, and manifeſted to them that asked not after me.</hi> At theſe words, all the ſtanders by, fixed their eies vpon him; and ſeing him to be a rude plaine man,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:181136:195"/>meanely apparelled, they know not what to make of his words nor what he ment by them. The preſident <hi>Pirrhus</hi> cauſing him to be brought neerer vnto him, demaunded of him, who he was? He aunſwered: I am <hi>Menna</hi> the ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST, who is Emperour of heauen and earth. The preſident enquired further. Art thou a ſtranger or a citiſen, that thou ſeekeſt to diſturb our feaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall showes in this manner? what is thy meaning herein? One of them which ſtood by ſaid vnto <hi>Pirrhus:</hi> I know the man well. He is a ſouldier of the regiment called <hi>Rutilica,</hi> whoſe Coronell is <hi>Firmilianus;</hi> and it is about fiue yeeres, ſince he abandoned the Enſigne, and left the warre. Then ſaid <hi>Pirrhus</hi> vnto him: Tell me, Art thou a ſoudier as this man ſaith? <hi>S. Menna</hi> anſwered: It is true, I was a ſouldier, but when the wicked Edict of your Emperours was proclaimed, I left the army, and departed from the warre. What mooued thee ſaid <hi>Pirrhus</hi> to leaue the warfare? Art thou a Grecian, or a Chriſtian? <hi>S. Menna</hi> anſwered: I haue bene, I am, and I deſire to be euer a Chriſtian. I left the hoſt, becauſe I would not be partaker of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties. So <hi>Pirrhus</hi> comitted him to cloſe priſon.</p>
               <p>On the next daie giuing audience, he comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Menna</hi> should be brought before him; and then he ſaid vnto him: Come hither thou preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous fellowe, what mooued thee to come into the Theater; and to hinder our feſtiuall daies, which are celebrated in the honor of our Gods? Whence art thou? why diddeſt thou leaue the armie? S. <hi>Menna</hi> anſwered: I am of <hi>Egipt,</hi> and becauſe I deſire to fight vnder the banner of IESVS CHRIST; I
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:181136:195"/>forſook your armies, which be but ſeeble, and weak. And where haſt thou bene, ſaid <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> all this time? <hi>Menna</hi> anſwered: I had rather liue a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie life, for the loue of my God in the companie of ſauage and wild beaſtes; then contine we with you, that know not the true God, and looſe my ſoule. for it is written: <hi>Lord do not deſtroy my ſoule with the ſinners, nor my life with the bloodthirſtie men.</hi> Softe, not ſo many words ſaid <hi>Pirrhus.</hi> Offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto the Gods; and they will reſtore vnto thee, the honorable offices thou haddſt in the hoſt, and augment the ſame alſo. <hi>Menna</hi> ſaid: I only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to pleaſe the eternall king, and of him to rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aue the crowne of imortallity. Looſe not time in threatning mee; for I regard not thy torments at all: but deſire rather to ſuffer, for the loue of Iesvs CHRIST my Lord, and my God.</p>
               <p>The Iudg comaunded: that <hi>Menna</hi> should be laid flat on the ground, and then to be beaten with rawe ſinewes of beaſtes, vntill he obeied the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundment of the Emperours. The executioners began to beat him rigorouſlv, and during the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a miniſter of the Idolls laboured by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to bring him to ſacrifice to their Gods. The bleſſed M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I would not do it at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Iudg, doeſt thou think that I will do it at thy perſwaſion? I giue thee to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I haue by my ſide IESVS CHRIST, who (for this which I ſuffer, and endure for his ſake) will giue vnto me, an eternall reward; and vnto you and your Emperours he will giue perpetuall

               <p>Forth with was prepared for him the torture with the cord; in the which the holie ſaint hanging on high, the Iudg ſaid vnto him: <hi>Menna,</hi> doeſt thou yet reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber thy ſelf, &amp; wilt thou yield, or shall we prouide greater torments? The bleſſed martir an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: very litle is that I haue yet ſuffred, to that, which my Lord and king deſerueth I should ſuffer for his ſake; becauſe he keepeth about me many Angells, that aſiſt and help me, encouraging me not to shrink at thy torments. <hi>Pirrhus</hi> ſaid: Scourge this villaine and rebell; yet more ſeuerely; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a king alreadie faith he hath another, which is not knowne. Then ſaid the ſaint: Thou indeed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not know him; for if thou diddſt, to haue his loue, thou wouldeſt forſake thine Emperours, ſince he can better reward thee, then they can. And who is this great and potent king ſaid <hi>Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus? S.

               <p>Then ſaid <hi>Pirrhus:</hi> Doeſt thou not know <hi>Menna,</hi> that to be the only cauſe, why our Emperours haue commaunded you Chriſtians to be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? namely, that you should neither profeſſe IESVS CHRIST for God, nor adore and worship him? <hi>Menna</hi> anſwered: what is that to me?

               <p>The Iudg commaunded his gashed and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded body, should be rubbed ouer, with rough sharp clothes: which paine he tollerated very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently. <hi>Pirrhus</hi> remained aſtonished hereat, and ſaid vnto him: verely <hi>Menna,</hi> it ſeemeth thy bodie, which is thus tormented, is not thine owne, but borrowed of ſome other. The martir anſwered him: I feele not thy torments, becauſe I haue my God by me, who doth helpe &amp; defend me; &amp; vnto thoſe that haue him with them, all things ſucceed proſperouſly. Then ſaid <hi>Pirrhus:</hi> ſet other burning torches vnto his ſides, that we may ouercome this his obſtinacy.</p>

Then ſaid the bleſſed martir: The ſame IESVS CHRIST our God, ſaid vnto vs: That when we should be brought before kings nad Iudges, for the profeſſion of his name, we should not care what to ſpeak, for that he would direct vs what we should anſwere. <hi>Pirrhus</hi> ſaid: Tell me <hi>Menna,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your CHRIST did foretell you, that you should ſuffer thoſe torments? yet ſurely (ſaid <hi>Menna</hi>) for that he, being God, knew right well, all that was to happen in after times.</p>
               <p>Well well (ſaid <hi>Pirrhus</hi>) leaue this vaine talk, made, and diuiſed of thine owne head, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto the Gods, or I will condemne thee to be conſumed with fire.

The Iudg ſaid: wilt thou haue daies of reſpitte, to conſider of this matter, that thou maiſt free thy ſelf from this thy blindnes and error? The bleſſed martir made anſwere: Long ſince haue I determined and reſolued, rather to die, then to deny my Lord CHRIST. I am a Chriſtian: and therefore expect not, that I will ſacrifice vnto the diuells. The Iudg was ſo wroth with this anſwere, that he cauſed calthropes to be ſet thick on the ground, &amp; the bleſſed martir to be dragged, and haled ouer them. In this torment the holie ſaint ſaid: Seek out other tortures, for theſe be of too ſmalle force to make me worship thy diuells. <hi>Pirrhus</hi> being now more enraged, ſaid: Beat him with cudgells, and knotted thongs of leather, and buffet him on the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:181136:197"/>face, till he ceaſe to call our Gods, by the names of diuells. But all theſe things preuailed not, to make the valiant ſouldier of CHRIST, shew any ſigne of feare, or yeelding.</p>

The preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſeing the conſtancy of the bleſſed martir, (by the aduiſe of the other courtiers) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned him to die, with theſe words: Becauſe <hi>Menna</hi> the ſouldier doth not obey the proclamation of the Emperours and becauſe he followeth the religion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and will not ſacrifice vnto our Gods, we comaund; that he be beheaded, that others (by his example) may feare, to comitt the like treſpaſſes.</p>
               <p>The bleſſed martir was led by the officers vnto a place called <hi>Potemia,</hi> vnto which all the cittie was aſſembled.

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:181136:198"/>with ſome of his acquaintance, as if he had not bene going vnto death. Recomending them vnto God, and taking leaue of them, he lifted his eies toward heauen, ſaying: I bleſſe, and praiſe thee, o father eternall, for that thou haſt hitherto kept me, and haſt not turned thy face from me, Thou haſt giuen me ſtrength, that I should not looſe my ſoule, with this treacherous and faithles people; but that I might confeſſe conſtantly thy bleſſed name, and thy holie lawe.

               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Martin</hi> the firſt Pope of that name, was the ſonne of one <hi>Fabritius,</hi> and borne in <hi>Todi</hi> a city in <hi>Tuſcane,</hi> a very holy man, and vertuous.

               <p>The legats of the Pope, who reſided there, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefied him of the proceedings of <hi>Paulus</hi> the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch; The Pope incontinent apointed by his letters what order should be taken therin, and wrot vnto the ſame <hi>Paulus</hi> louing letters, beſeeching him; not to be ſo determinately ſtubborne in ruynating the peace of the Church, and in patronizing of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ſo many times condemned by the holy prelats ingreat aſſembles, and generall Councells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulus</hi> being by nature proud and obſtinate, to shew what ſmall accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he made of the Popes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſements, cauſed an <hi>Aultar,</hi> which the legats had ſet vp in the Church, founded by <hi>Placida,</hi> (vpon which they ſaid maſſe, after the Roman vſe) to be caſt to the ground, and defaced. The malice of <hi>Paulus</hi> was ſo much augmented, that becauſe the legats, on the Popes behalf, required him, (when they ſawe his obſtinacy) to amend his fault, and reforme his errors, or els they would proceed againſt him as a contumacious perſon, by the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church, he made meanes to th'empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to cauſe the legats to be reſtrained of their
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:181136:199"/>liberty and euill entreated; and afterward he ſent them into banishment, into ſondry parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, which was; as if he had ſent trompets, to ſound and publish the malignity of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, the tiranny of th'emperour, and the misbelief of them both, being obſtinate in the error, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by all the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>when Pope <hi>Martin</hi> had vnderſtanding thereof, he had recourſe vnto the ordinary remedies, in the like occaſions; and aſſembled a Councell of 105. Bishops in the Church of S. <hi>Saluator,</hi> neere vnto S. <hi>Iohn La'eranne.</hi> And the queſtion of the afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentioned errors, being againe diſputed, certein Canons were published, by which, all the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hereſies, and this alſo, being lately reuiued, were condemned, and anathematiſed; and with them <hi>Peter, Cirus,</hi> and <hi>Sergius</hi> their Patriarchs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed; accurſing, deteſting, and depriuing <hi>Paulus</hi> the Patriarch now liuing, and all his followers and adherents, of what ſtate, condition, dignity, or function ſo euer; and depriuing them alſo of all offices, and benefices eccleſiaſticall. And to the end, this holy Councell, and all the decrees and Canons of the ſame, should be diuulged, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished through the world, Pope <hi>Martin</hi> cauſed many coppies to be ſent into moſt parts thereof.</p>
               <p>Th'emperour <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stans</hi> vnderſtanding, what the Pope had done in the Councell, tooke ſuch indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation therat, that he determined to apprehend, (if he did not kill) the Pope, in reuenge of this iniury as he eſtemed it. For this purpoſe, he ſent into <hi>Italy</hi> (in which, at that time, the Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had ſome cities and countreis)
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:181136:200"/>one <hi>Olimpius,</hi> a noble man of his chamber, but an heretike, as he himſelf was, and gaue vnto him the title of Exark, or Regent, with ſecret inſtructions what to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olimpius</hi> arriued at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> which was the ordinary place of reſidence of the Exarks, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing amaſſed and gathered huge forces, as he could, went toward <hi>Rome,</hi> where he endeuored to make a ſchiſme in the Churche of God. But not being able to compaſſe and effect it, becauſe the Bishops of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Clergy of the city were of one accord, and held together, in the defence of the faith, and of the Pope: he then diuiſed meanes to entrap the Pope, and to take him priſoner. But finding it hard to be effected, becauſe he could not get him out' of <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was well beloued, and had many frends: he laſtly determined to kill him.</p>
               <p>For the effectuating of this deuiſe, he agreed with one of his ſeruaunts, an auncient ſouldier, and told him: he had procured the Pope to ſay Maſſe, the day following, in S. <hi>Maria Maior,</hi> where he would require the Pope, to giue him the <hi>B. Sacrament;</hi> and as he communicated, this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fellow should come nere, and ſtabbe the Pope with his dagger. The ſouldier promiſed ſo do. The next day came, and the Pope ſaid Maſſe, and <hi>Olimpius,</hi> like another <hi>Iudas,</hi> came vp to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; yet lingered, till his man came, that should do this treacherous deed. but our B. God altered all this: for he cauſed the man to looſe his ſight, and though he was hard by the Pope, yet he ſawe him not: which thing he confeſſed many times after
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:181136:200"/>with ſolemne oths. By this meanes this infernall ſacriledg was not committed, and the holy Pope eſcaped free from this trecherous inuention.</p>
               <p>Aftetwadrs the Sarracens inuaded the Iſland of <hi>Sycile,</hi> in the which they made great ſpoile, and by cauſe at that time, it was ſubiect vnto th'empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <hi>Olimpius</hi> was obliged to go and defend them and ſo he did; being firſt reconciled to the Pope, and making vnto him a relation of the true cauſes of his comming into <hi>Italy. Olimpius</hi> fought with the Saracens in a pitcht field, &amp; vanquished them; yet ſo great was the toile he took in the battaile, that a few dais after he deceaſed.</p>
               <p>When th'emperour was aduertiſed of his death, he ſent in his place as Exark, <hi>Theodorus Calliopa,</hi> who had bene there before, and had behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well, that he was beloued in <hi>Rome</hi> and all <hi>Italy.</hi> Euery one reioiced at his coming; but at the end, euery one was deceiued and deluded: for th'emperour had drawne him vnto his opinion, and had enioined him; that, aſſoone as he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned the Pope, he ſhould ſend him vnto th'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with a ſtrong guard. And becauſe he had no aſſured confidence in him, he ioined with him in commiſſion (for the affaires and buſines with the Pope only) one <hi>Paulus Pallurius</hi> a ſeruant of his, of whom he had this opinion; that he would not faile to performe, what ſoeuer he should command him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calliopa</hi> and his aſſociate arriued at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> and with outlong ſtay, went vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> where he ſtaied ſome fewe daies, treating with the Pope about many and ſeuerall buſineſſes: but all that he
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:181136:201"/>did, was in deceit. The Pope, (who was a plaine meaning man) had no conceit of the treachery which <hi>Calliopa</hi> entended toward him. So that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liopa</hi> one day fained (being in the lodgiing of S. <hi>Iohn Laterane</hi>) to go and viſite the Pope: but in ſteed thereof, he laid blowes on him, and the Pope being vnable to defend him ſelf from that violence was put in priſon. <hi>Calliopa</hi> ſent him incontinent in bonds vnto <hi>Paulus Pellarius,</hi> who conueied him withall ſpeed vnto <hi>Rauenna,</hi> and from thence vnto <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wicked emperour <hi>Conſtans</hi> reioiced excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that he had gotten the Pope into his hands, and endeuored with flattery and faire promiſes, to drawe the good Pope to fauor his error, but finding him ſtedfaſt in his faith, he banished him vnto the city of <hi>Cherſona,</hi> which is in the outmoſt borders of the ſea <hi>Euxinus,</hi> a very cold country, &amp; almoſt inhabitable. There the good Pope was ſo afflicted, and euill entreated; that within fewe daies, he died very patiently, as a glorious martir of IESVS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the firſt of that name, after the moſt certain account, died in the year of our Lord. 654. on the. 12. day of <hi>Nouember,</hi> and on the ſame day, the Church celebrateth his feaſt. His body was after this brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and buried in the Church dedicated vnto him and S. <hi>Silueſter. God</hi> did many miracles by the meanes of this ſaint, who was his vicar in earth 6. yeares one moenth &amp; 26. dayes.

                  <hi>We do not read, that our Sauiour</hi> CHRIST <hi>did any of theſe thinges. we doubt not but he could haue done them; yet he did them not, that his words might be full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, when he ſaid: that his faithfull ſeruants should do greater miracles (after a certaine manner) then thoſe that he did. And becauſe it was euident in this holie ſaint, he had the ſurname of</hi> Thaumaturgus, <hi>that is a doer of marueilous things, giuen vnto him. His life was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by</hi> S. Gregorie Niſſen <hi>in this manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Thaumaturgus,</hi> was borne in the cittie of <hi>Neocaeſaria,</hi> of honorable parents; and euen from his childhood he ſpent his youth in all vertuous exerciſes. When he grew to more yeares, he gaue himſelf vnto the ſtudie of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:181136:202"/>philoſophie, by which he came vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that the adoration vſed by the pagans, was a vaine thing, and without foundation, and that there neither was, nor could be any more, then one God only. This was the cauſe, that he liſtened willinglie vnto the Ghoſpell, and to the faith of CHRIST; for that he perceiued, that the ſame acknowledged one God only. He ſaw alſo, that the thing which the Chriſtian beleeueth although it ſurpaſſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon, (ſince a philoſopher cannot attaine by naturall reaſon ſome things) yet nothing is quite contrarie vnto the ſame reaſon: which hapeneth not in any other ſects. Laſtly, being ayded by God, he determined to be a Chriſtian; and came vnto Baptiſme, without thoſe things, which others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaning the ſame at his age, do bring with them.</p>
               <p>And if vntill that time, he had loued the morall vertues, now he exerciſed himſelf much more in them, and namely his great chaſtitie, which made other yong men of his yeeres, to be ashamed of their lewdnes, and wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes. His humillitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued their pride; his mildnes &amp; patience their intemperance; ſo that they enuyed him, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with crymes falſly and ſlanderouſly, to the end, he should not be accounted better, and more vertuous then they. And vpon this, they made an accord with a lewd woman, perſwading her; that at ſuch time as <hi>Gregorie</hi> was in the company of other philoſophers, and wiſemen, she should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of him and ſay: that he had the vſe of her bodie, promiſing her a certaine ſome of mony; but afterward, that he deceiued her, and gaue her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:181136:202"/>
               <p>S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> was on a time in company with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons, who gaue willing eare vnto him, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of certaine ſubtile queſtions, with admirable grace and eloquence; his apparell being comely, but meane, ſuch as he vſed euery daie. The lewd woman came in, and made her dishoneſt, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true complaint; and partly threatned, according to the apointment giuen her. They which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, hearing this, turned from the woman, and fixed their eyes on S. <hi>Gregorie.</hi> Yet knowing right well that he was cleere from ſuch a matter, and that it was a ſuborned accuſation; they turned back vnto the woman, minding to thruſt her head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long out of dores. But the bleſſed man, without changing his countenance, or forſwering the act, calling one of his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſaid vnto him: Giue vnto that woman what she demandeth, leaſt she hinder our diſcourſes. The ſeruant asked the woman, what his maſter ought her, and she telling him, he paid it to her.</p>
               <p>But God would not permitte the chaſtitie of this holie man, to be thus ſtayned; and the woman to eſcape without due punishment. for she had no ſooner receaued the mony, but the diuell entred, and took poſeſſion of her, tormenting her in ſuch ſort, that euery one perceiued her wickednes. Yet the holie man, was mooued vnto compaſſion, and prayed ſo long, and feruently for her, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell departed, and left her free. The woman being recouered, published openly her owne iniquitie, and told how she was hyred by thoſe vngracious, andenuious yong men, to do, and ſay, that which she had ſaid, and done. Neuertheleſſe, S. <hi>Gregorie</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:181136:203"/>was better content to be accounted bad, then to be ſo indeed.</p>
               <p>He hauing now proffited ſufficiently in huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and philoſophie, grew to the ſtudy of the holie ſcripture; hauing for his maſter <hi>Origen,</hi> a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his deſire, &amp; moſt renowned through Chriſtendome in thoſe daies, as well in diuinity, as in good and vertuous life. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> went to find him out, and became his diſciple, remaining in his companie ſo long, as was ſufficient, by reaſon of his aptnes, and quick witt. Then returned he vnto his natiue country, where euery one expected, that he would diſcouer, and lay open, the treaſures, which he had gotten in his ſtudies; that he might reap ſome fruite, with fame, and honor for his long trauells. But he, to auoide worldlie glorie, (taking ſome of his familier friends in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,) went into a deſert, liuing ſolitarily with them, in continuall penitence, ſpending the greateſt part of his time in prayer, and reading the holie ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>There was at that time, a holie man called <hi>Fedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> who was not only a great ſcholler, but alſo very vertuous. He much deſired, that in the cittie of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> (the natiue place of <hi>Gregorie</hi>) there should be a Bishop, that Idollatry (which was ſtrong in that place) might be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelled, and that Chriſtianine might be augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for it was openly ſaid: that in all that cittie, there were but 17. perſons, that profeſſed the faith of CHRIST. This good paſtor thought <hi>Gregorie</hi> would be a fit man for that place, the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his learning and life, being ſo diuulged into<pb n="381" facs="tcp:181136:203"/>diuers partes. He went into the deſert to find him, with entent, to giue him the order of prieſthood, and make him Bishop of that cittie.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> being certified thereof, left his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, shifting from one place to another. <hi>Fedimus</hi> laboured to find him, ſo that the one ſought him, to make him Bishop, and the other fled from that high dignitie. At laſt <hi>Fedimus</hi> being wearie with ſeeking him, and they being three daies iourney one from the other, <hi>Fedimus</hi> lifted vp his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heauen and ſaid: O Lord, thou ſeeſt right well, both me and <hi>Gregorie:</hi> I deſired to haue him preſent, that I might haue layd my hands vpon him, and haue conſecrated him; but let my wordes work the ſame effect: I conſecrate, and offer him vnto thee (ô Lord) and vnto him I giue the charge of the cittie of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> that he may ſpread the Ghoſpell therein, and in the territorie thereof, that thy faith and ſeruants, may increaſe and multiplie, to the honor and glorie, of thy moſt holie name. Theſe words ſaid <hi>Fedimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> hearing and vnderſtanding theſe words, yealded, and would not reſiſt any longer; ſuppoſing, that if he had done ſo, he should haue reſiſted the will of God. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came vnto <hi>Fedimus</hi> of himſelf, and by his preſence was performed all the ceremonies, which in ſuch a caſe are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be done, for the making of a prieſt and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> required reſpite for a time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein he might ſtudie, how he might beſt exerciſe his office; which being granted, he ſpent certaine daies in praiers, deſiring God to inſtruct, and shew him, how he should performe his dutie.</p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:181136:204"/>
               <p>Whileſt he was in his deuout praiers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, there apeared vnto him the mother of God, and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt, his eſpeciall aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats. And, by the apointment of the B. virgin, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue him inſtructions, in what manner he should gouerne; and of the miſterie of the holie Trinitie, teaching him, what he should ſaie, and what definitions, and words he should vſe. They commaunded him to go forthwith into the cittie, and to begin to preach, and conuert ſoules vnto God. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> obeying forthwith, went on his iourney with his familiers and friends, that were in his companie.</p>
               <p>As they trauailed, they neere benighted, were vnto a Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> not farre diſtant from the cittie, into the which, S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> and his friends entring, he made the ſigne of the Croſſe in the ayre, and forthwith flew away a huge companie of diuells, which inhabited there, and gaue oracles &amp; anſweres vnto ſuch perſons, as came to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto them. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſpent the greateſt part of the night in praiers, and ſinging Himnes and Pſalmes, ſo that the place, that was before the habitation of diuells, became now the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>In the morning, S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> departing to go on his iourney, the miniſters of the Idolls, (who had the charge of the Temple,) entred therein to, and making their acuſtomed ſalutations and ſacrifices vnto the Idoll; in ſtead of anſwere, there was heard yellings, and howlings out of the Temple, and the diuells ſaid: that they could not enter againe into that houſe, becauſe <hi>Gregorie</hi> had bene within it.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:181136:204"/>Notwithſtanding, the miniſters made ſacrifice vnto them, and vſed certaine ceremonies, to induce them to returne into the Temple: but they bad tho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to wearie themſelfs, nor to looſe their time, for they could not returne into that place by any meanes. The miniſters were alſo informed, that it was <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and where they should find him. Hauing learned this, they determined to follow him, and found him and his companie, as they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked toward the cittie.</p>
               <p>The miniſters of the Idolls, began to threaten him, that they wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld complaine to the maieſtrates of the cittie, for that he, being a Chriſtian, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a Temple of their Gods, and driuen them from their habitation, ſo making their Oracles to ceaſe. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> with great mildnes and modeſty ſaid: Be not offended hereat: for I ſerue ſuch a Lord, as I can in his name, caſt out diuells from any place, and make them to returne whither I pleaſe. They maruailing hereat, ſaid vnto him: Then make them returne into the Temple, where they were before. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> rent a leafe out of a paper book he had, and wrote thereon theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: <hi>Gregorie</hi> to <hi>Satanas,</hi> ENTER. This note he gaue vnto the miniſter, who laid it vpon the Altar, and offred ſacrifice, and the diuells gaue anſweres as beforetime.</p>
               <p>The miniſter pondered vpon this, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that when <hi>Gregorie</hi> commaunded their Gods, they obeyed him; and that he did it, by his ſeruice vnto one God. Hereupon he reſolued, that this God was very potent and mighty, ſince his ſeruants could do ſuch great things. After this reſolution
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:181136:205"/>made, he departed from the Temple to ſeek out <hi>Gregorie,</hi> (who by Gods prouidence had done theſe things, expecting the fruite to come thereof) and found him. He told him what had happened, and beſought him inſtantly, to inſtruct him, what his God was, (ſo great and potent) for he would ſerue him, and forſake theſe other Gods, ſo weak, and feeble. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> preached vnto him IESVS CRH<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>T, and hauing giuen him notice of the principall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our faith, ſaid: we do not prooue theſe things by reaſons, becauſe they ſurmount reaſon, and naturall vnderſtanding; but we confirme them by miracles. The miniſter of the Idolls ſaid: do a miracle in my ſight, that I may beleeue what you haue ſaid, and Baptiſe me. What miracle would you haue me do (ſaid S. <hi>Gregerie.</hi>) The miniſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding a huge great ſtone, like a mountaine, ſaid vnto him make this huge ſtone, to raiſe it ſelf from this place; and to go into another. S <hi>Gregorie</hi> doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to do it, and as if the ſtone had bene a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, he commaunded it to go vnto the place the miniſter had apointed. His words being ended, the effect followed. The miniſter remained ſo ſatisfied herewith, that he, his wife and children, ſeruants and friends (vnto whom he related the matter performed by the ſaint,) were all Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> came into the cittie, and lodged in the houſe of a great man called <hi>Muſonius.</hi> To this houſe reſorted many, vnto whom the holy ſaint prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſuch feruour, that in a short ſpace there were thouſands of Chriſtians in that cittie. In this diſcourſes he gaue content, and delight to all. To
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:181136:205"/>the diſcomforted, he vſed ſuch wordes, that they took conſolation. He perſwaded the yong men to chaſtity, the old men vnto patience. He exhorted ſeruants to be obedient to their maſters, &amp; aduiſed maſters to be mild and courteous to their ſeruants. He ſaid: rich men ought to be ſtewards, and not maſters of their goodes. To women, children, and all other that came to heare him, he ſpake that which was conuenient, and fitting for their eſtates; reaping daily proffit by his preaching.</p>
               <p>There was in that citty many Temples of the Idolls, whereupon, the holie ſaint thought fitt, that there should be one at leaſt built to the honour of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, wherein he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght be adored, and ſerued. The charge hereof, he gaue vnto the chiefeſt of them that were Baptiſed, and himſelf in perſon laid the firſt ſtone in the foundation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius Caeſarienſis</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">

               <p>Among many other wonders, this of the two brethren is notable. They two deuiding the many poſeſſions and land left vnto them by their father,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:181136:206"/>fell at variance about a water, which controuerſie was cauſed by a great lake, in which much fishe was taken, and each of them deſired, to haue that water for their part. This matter came to that height, that they had aſſembled many people, and intended to end their quarrelly by the ſword. The holie ſaint came betweene them as vmprie; but ſeing no meanes to bring them to atoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, (they being euen ready to come to handy ſtrokes, hard by the lake, and it was feared much blood would he shed;) This glorious ſaint fell vnto praier, and continewed therein ſo long, till the water in the lake was dried vp; and the ground thereof was equall with the banckes; ſo that there remained no ſigne, either of water, or lake. When the morning came, the two enraged brethren, ſeing now no cauſe wondering at this great miracle, that God had done, by the meanes and prayer of his ſeruant <hi>Gregorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this miracle, enſued another. The people dwelling by the bancks of the riuer <hi>Lyous,</hi> (which deſcendeth from the mountaines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſometimes encreaſeth ſo much, that it ouerfloweth and ſpoileth the fieldes and villages of the country neere adiacent) hauing knowledg giuen them of S. <hi>Gregorie.</hi> ſent meſſengers, requeſting him, to vouchſaffe to come, &amp; giue remedie hereunto: for they were not able, by mans wit, or any ſtrength to reſtraine it. The holie prelate went thither, and veiwed well the place; and conſidering withall, that it would be inconuenient for them to remooue their dwellings, hauing their houſes ready built,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:181136:206"/>and their ground about them; He took his ſtaffe which he vſually carried in his hand, and planted it a prettie diſtance from the Riue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; on that ſide, from whence the ouerflowing came, and where the plaine fields were, and many houſes of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. This holie ſaint hauing planted his ſtaffe, went vnto praier, and not long after, the ſtaffe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed greene, grew, and became a verie great tree. Then <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> ſaid: this shalbe the boundes of this floud, and the water shall not paſſe this marke. This bleſſed man returned into the cittie, and it was after ſeene by experience, that when the riuer roſe to the hghieſt, aſſoone as the waters came vnto that tree, they returned back, and ran downe the channell againe, not ouerflowing, as they had done before-time. By theſe, and ſuch like workes, that S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> did, both in the cittie, and in the countrie abroad, the number of the faithfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed continually; all ſortes of people making great account of him; being aduiſed, and directed by his counſell, in all their important, and waightie affaires.</p>
               <p>The citiſens of a cittie thereby, ſent vnto <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie,</hi> beſeeching him to come, and apoint ouer them a prelate. <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> comming thither, and examining ſome of thoſe that ſtood for that digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was neither ſatisfied, nor liked not at all of them. The people with one voyce, ſaid as it were in ſcorne; If <hi>Gregorie</hi> like none of theſe, let him take <hi>Alexander</hi> the collier. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> hearing theſe wordes, demanded what that <hi>Alexander</hi> was, and apointed them to bring him to his lodging. This <hi>Alexander</hi> was a man of middle age, meanlie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:181136:207"/>his handes and face being black with coales. Thoſe that brought him laughed, and ſo did they that were with S. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and the collier him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf laughed, ſeing them to laugh at him; being well pleaſed, to be contemned, and ſcoffed at by them. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> beheld him, not as others did; but thought that vnder that contemptible shewe, lay hid things of greater valew. He called him aſide, and charged him deeplie, to tell him ſincerely who he was. The collier opened trulie his whole life vnto him, to witt: that he was a philoſopher; and that to auoid the vaine-glorie of the world, he had taken this courſe of life; and had made himſelf a collier, not for neceſſitie, to get his liuing, but for the deſire he had to liue chaſt, for liuing thus (ſaith he) I haue no mind of any dishoneſtie, nor any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will tempt me vnto lewdnes, ſeing me ſo black and vnlouelie. moreouer this good collier ſaid: that the greater part of the gaines of his coales, he gaue vnto the poore, fullfilling the counſell of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> cauſed him to be ſtripped out of his clothes, his hands and face to be washed, and then to be apparelled with the like garments as he wore himſelf. Then aſſembling the people together, he told them: he had now found out, and made choiſe of ſuch a Bishop as was fitt for place. They with great attention, expecting the perſon elected by ſo wiſe, and holie a man, behold, <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> the collier came out, apparailed after the ſame manner that S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> was, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the ſame familiers, and friends. Thoſe that were preſent, knew not whether they should
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:181136:207"/>laugh, or take it in euill part, that ſuch a one should be giuen them for their Bishop. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> made aſpeech vnto them aduertiſing them, what a man <hi>Alexander</hi> was, whom he comaunded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach in their hearing. The new Bishop obeyed, and preached in ſuch ſort, that they all remayned no leſſe aſtonied, then ſatisfied. Thus they being all pleaſed to haue him for their prelate, <hi>Gregorie,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated him Bishop of that cittie; and he diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his office with great comendation.</p>
               <p>After this, the holie man returning vnto his cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was met by two Iewes (in the high way) who knowing him, accorded together to deceaue him. The one of them lay flat on the ground, faining himſelf to be dead, and the other wailed, and made great lamentation. The holie ſaint coming by, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him the cauſe of his ſorrow? The Iew anſwered. O ſeruant of God, vouchſaffe to help &amp; comfort me: look with pittie vpon the miſerie of this my compagnion, who is fallen dead on a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, and I haue not any thing to wrap him in before he be buried. The good man being mooued to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion, put of one of his garments (as we may ſaie his rochett) and laying it on the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite dead man, went on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ourney, leauing the Iewes alone.</p>
               <p>The man that had vſed this deceit toward the holie ſaint, and had told him that his fellow was dead, came merrilie to his companion and ſaid: Come fellow, riſe vp now, we haue gotten a good priſe ſee; we haue gained this good garment, and deceiued this man whom the Chriſtians hold to be ſo wiſe. But the Iew which lay on the ground anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:181136:208"/>not, nor ſturred any whit at all. The other ſpoke louder and ſaid: O how cuninglie thou canſt counter faite? but I praie thee riſe now, for heere is not any bodie neere vs. Yet for all this, the Iew laie ſtill, and ſtirred not. For aſſoone as the garment of S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> laie vpon him, and touched him, he was depriued of his life. And ſo the ieſt, and ſcoffe returned, and light vpon himſelf in good earneſt.</p>
               <p>In thoſe times there was raiſed a moſt grieuous perſecution againſt the Chriſtians, and the Edicts of the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> were proclaimed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein they comaunded: that the Chriſtians ſhould either ſacrifiſe vnto the Idolls, or elſe, that they should be put vnto moſt cruell death. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations came vnto <hi>Neoceſaria,</hi> and S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> being certified thereof, admonished publiklie, and aduiſed the Catholiques, to giue place vnto this furie, by departing from the cittie, vntill this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſtorme were paſſed ouer. And himſelf alſo by diuine inſpiration (as afterward appeared) went with one of his diſciples (who had bene mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Idolls, and was conuerted, and made deacon by him) vnto a mountaine, and there lay cloſe certaine daies. Other Chriſtians diſperſed themſelues into diuers partes.</p>
               <p>It was a lamentable thing, and would haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oued a ſtony hart vnto compaſſion, to ſee the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie that was vſed in <hi>Neoceſaria,</hi> and the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the pagans; who continuallie prepared chaines, gallowſes, ſwordes, ſauage beaſtes, and an infinite number of other tortures, and all to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Chriſtians. You should haue ſeene the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:181136:208"/>fathers to perſecute their ſonnes, and the ſonnes to perſecute their owne fathers. The brother procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the death of the brother, and one friend ſought the death of another friend. Some did this vnder shew of relligion, others for mallice, and moſt, to make themſelues rich with the goods of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For theſe cauſes they ſought for them, found them out, aprehended them, put them in priſon, and at the end, vnto ſome cruell death.</p>
               <p>Notice was giuen (by ſome informers) that <hi>Gregorie</hi> laie hidden in the mountaine: whereupon officers were ſent forth with to aprehend him. for the iudges thought, that if they put him to death being the cheif, the inferior Chriſtians would be diſcouraged, to make ſuch bold profeſſion of their faith. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> (being on the mountaine) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his deacon to make his oraiſons. So both of them kneeling with their hands lifted vp to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen, ſomewhat diſtant the one from the other, they beſought God, if it were for his ſeruice, that he would deliuer them from the perſecution: but if his will was, that they should dye for his ſake, and loue of his holie Goſpell, they did like wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that his will might be done. The ſouldiers arryuing at the mountaine, went vp and downe all the hill, ſearching for them, and returned vnto the Iudge, telling him: that they had found noting but two trees, ſomewhat diſtant the one from the other. The Iudg knew for certaine, that <hi>Gregorie</hi> was on the mountaine, and therefore he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perſon alone, finding thoſe that ſeemed to the ſouldiers to be trees, to be <hi>Gregorie</hi> and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acon at their praiers. When the Iudg ſaw this
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:181136:209"/>wonder, God ſo touched his hart, that he went vnto S. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and fell at his feete confeſſing IESVS CHRIST to be the true God. And he that before perſecuted them, from thenceforth was one of them that fled from the perſecution.</p>
               <p>Another time, the holie ſaint being in praier, and with him ſome of his diſciples (with his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con) he lifted vp his voice on a ſodaine ſaying theſe words of <hi>Dauid:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſa:</hi> 123.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed be our Lord, who hath not ſuffred vs to be taken in their teeth.</hi> His diſciples asked him why he ſaid theſe wordes? and he anſwered: that in that very inſtant of time, was finished in the citie the martyrdome of a Chriſtian, who had valiantlie ouercome his perſecutors, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing firme and conſtant in the faith of CHRIST; and ſaid he was called <hi>Troadius.</hi> The deacon asked leaue of the holie ſaint, and went ſecretlie into the cittie, finding all that the bleſſed man had ſaid, to be verie true.</p>
               <p>The perſecution then ceaſing S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto this Church, and recollected together the faith full beleeuers, that were diſperſed by flight, into ſundrie partes, ſetling himſelf againe, vnto the preaching of the faith. By which meanes, ſome that shewed themſelues weak, in the time ef per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, were reduced againe to a good eſtate, and many Gentiles were Baptiſed. He vſed great dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to know them that had bene martyred, and apointed that their feaſts should be kept euery yeare, on the ſame daie, on which they had beene put to death,</p>
               <p>The good father was now verie old, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his death aproached, he deſired to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:181136:209"/>how many Idolaters and vnbeleeuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in that cittie.

I am much agreeued (ſaid the holie faint) that theſe continew in ſuch an error; but yet I yeeld infinite thancks vnto God, becauſe I leaue behind me vnto my ſucceſſor, but ſo many vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers in the Bishoprike, as I found beleeuers when I was conſecrated Bishop. Then made he his praier for the Catholique Chriſtians deſiring God to giue them grace, to continew in his ſeruice: and he beſought thoſe that were preſent, that they would bury him amongſt others, and not in any peculier graue of his owne. For I would haue it ſaid of me when I am gone; that I had not in my life time an houſe of mine owne, nor after my death a ſepulcre. This glorious ſaint, rendred his ſoule vnto God, on the 17. daie of <hi>Nouember,</hi> and on the ſame daie, the Catholique Church celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his feaſt.</p>
               <p>His body was buried as he had apointed; all the people making great lamentation, but eſpecially his diſciples, and houshold ſeruants, for looſing ſo louing a father; and ſo good a maſter; although they were comforted, knowing for certaine, that they had him for their patrone, and aduocate in heauen.

               <p>
                  <hi>For this cauſe the holy Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>celebrateth the feaſt of the building of the Church of our Sauiour, and of the Apoſtles</hi> S. Peter <hi>and</hi> S.

               </p>
               <p>IT was a cuſtome in the Primitiue Church for the Chriſtians, to aſſemble together, in priuar and ſet places, to celebrate the diuine office, to hear maſſe, to receue the B. ſacrament, to heare the word of God preached, and to make praier. They were aſſembled to do theſe things, eſpecially, in
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:181136:210"/>the places where the martirs had bene buried; and among other, one part of the <hi>Vatican</hi> was highly regarded, which they called the <hi>Confeſſion of</hi> S. <hi>Peter;</hi> for that his B. body had bene in that place enterred and thither reſorted people from all parts of the world to giue honor and reuerence vnto it.</p>
               <p>To that ſame place came th'emperour <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> the Great. 8. daies after he was Baptiſed, where he made his praier, and shed many tears. Then he took a mattock and digged vp. 12. baskets of earth, which he himſelf caried away in honor of the. 12. Apoſtles, in which place they should build a Church vnto S. <hi>Peter</hi> the head of them. Hauing thus begon, the work was continewed &amp; finished and S. <hi>Silueſter</hi> the Pope conſecrated it, on the 18. day of <hi>Nouember</hi> in the year of our Lord. 325. euen as he had conſecrated the Church of S. <hi>Sauiour</hi> on the 9. day of the ſame moneth.</p>
               <p>He made there an Altare of ſtone, and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, ordeining, that from thensforth the Altars should be made of ſtone. The ſame Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin</hi> cauſed another Church to be builded in the honor of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the way to <hi>Hostia,</hi> and enriched the one &amp; theother with reuenewes, and adorned them with veſſells and iewells of great value. Great was the feruour and deſire this Prince had, to raze to the ground the temples of the Idolls, through all the world; and to build Churches, to the honor of CHRIST &amp; his ſaints: but eſpecially in <hi>Rome,</hi> where beſide the aforenamed, he builded in the field <hi>Soſſorium,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Holy Croſſe,</hi> that is called in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and in the field <hi>Veranius,</hi> without the walles, he built the

               </p>
               <p>Hither to we haue ſeene the occaſion of the feaſt, the Church celebrateth, the which is, The dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of the Apoſtles S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Nowe it wilbe good to ſee the reaſon why the Church maketh ſuch account of theſe holy Apoſtles, and of all theother martirs and ſaints, that it buildeth Churches vnto them, in which the faithfull do aſſemble, to celebrat their feaſts. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer it shalbe good to ſee, what is the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Vigills and Octaues; and for what cauſe there is a greater feaſt kept of one ſaint, more then of another. Theſe may be thought by ſome, to be but curious queſtions, yet they may be profitable, and it is very good (in my oppinion) that euery Chriſtian should know the reaſon therof.</p>
               <p>Firſt I ſay, that the Catholik Church hath had many reſpects to celebrat the feaſts of the ſaints. On was, for that in the primitiue Church they deſiring to extirpate totally the adoration of the Idolls (wherin the Painims were drowned,) the holy Bishops brought in this vertuous cuſtome of worshipping the holy ſaints, to the end, the memory of <hi>Iupiter, Saturn, Apollo, Venus, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> and of the other Gods might be abolished, by ſubſtituting in the place of them <hi>S. Peter, S. Paul. S. Iames S. Iohn, S. Stephen,</hi> S. <hi>Laurence, S. Agnes,</hi> S. <hi>Agatha,</hi> S. <hi>Lucia,</hi> and theother ſaints.</p>
               <p>Theother reaſon, that moued the Church was this, that in honoring, and making feaſts to the ſaints, there is feaſt made, and honor done vnto
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:181136:211"/>God himſelf, that made them ſaints.</p>
               <p>The Church had alſo another regard, viz: to ſatisfy the obligement and duety we all haue and owe vnto the ſaints. They reioice in heauen, and make triumph, when we conuert our ſelues vnto God; and therefore it is reaſon we should make feaſt, and reioyce in that day, that they begin to enioy the ſight of God in heauen; viz: the day of their death.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the feaſts of the Saints are celebrated becauſe of the great neede we haue of them, that they may pray vnto God for vs, the he may truly conuert vs vnto him; that he may giue vs perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; that he may deliuer vs from tentations; that he may teach vs to do his will; &amp; that he may giue vs things neceſſary for the ſuſtenaunce of our life. All theſe things, &amp; many other ſuch like, God doth giue vs, by the praiers of his ſaints. And therefore it is reaſon, that in ſome part, we do ſatisfy our great obligement, that we owe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by celebrating their feaſts.</p>
               <p>Another motion the Church hath to celebrate the feaſts of the ſaints, was for our example. for when we conſider, that the ſaints were men as we be, formed of fleſh and bone, and ſubiect vnto the ſame frailty, and miſery of our natures; yet that they did ſuch famous acts, and heroicall deeds; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and enduring ſuch outragious paines in their martirdome; ſuch cruell perſecutions, horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reproches, &amp; laſtly death; by which they came to be ſo honored and rewarded by God in heauen: we alſo moued by their example, should ſtriue to imitate them. To this purpoſe, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:181136:212"/>they do truly celebrate the feaſt of the martirs, who followe their examples: for he, who doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe them in what he can,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> can not enioy beati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>Virgills</hi> of Saints, Iſay: that a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill properly is not a day of faſting, but of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſo it was vſed in the feaſts of IESVS CHRIST, of the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> of the Apoſtles, and of ſome other ſaints; eſpecially of the patrons of the Church, when all the people, the night before the day of the feaſt, came vnto the Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there all the night in praier, and other holy exerciſes. This holy and good cuſtome began ſome what to be corrupted: for the people, who kept the vigills, if they ſpent a litle time in praier, they ſpent a great deale more in eating and drinking; and ſometime in gaming, lewd talk, &amp; vncomely beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior: yea, it came to ſuch a paſſe, that many foule and groſſe abuſes were vſed in the Church. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this miſchief, <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> (who was enformed therof by <hi>S. Monica,</hi> the mother of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> at her being at <hi>Millaine</hi>) did in his Church, as other Bishops in their dioceſſes, &amp; the Pope through all Chriſtendome, change the vigills and watchings into faſting, the day before the feſtiuall day, and yet it reteineth the auncient anme of vigill ſtill.</p>
               <p>The vigill ſignifieth alſo this preſent life: in the which, we muſt be vigilant, and muſt ſupport trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as the body doth endure troble by faſting; that we may haue the feaſt in the next life. But he, that on the contrary ſide will firſt haue the feaſt before
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:181136:212"/>the faſt, and wilbe mery and take his pleaſure in the world; let ſuch a one know, that he muſt make a long and greuous vigill in theother life: for he shall abide in hell faſting for euer.</p>
               <p>For the Octaues: the Church began to celebrat them in imitation of certain feaſts the hebrews had, which laſted ſeuen daies, as the <hi>Paſcha</hi> of the vnleuened bread; the feaſt of Tabernacles; and the Dedication of the Temple: So the Church ordeined, that ſome of her feaſts, which are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all honour and reuerence, (as well as they were) should haue Octaues; to the end, the ſolemnity should be greater: and in the office of theſe daies, are many things read of thoſe ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the faithfull might heare and conſider the ſame, and take profit thereby.</p>
               <p>We read that the Idollaters aſſaulted the Macchabeis on the day of the feaſt; and that they, becauſe they would not violat it, (for they thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght it was a work to defend themſelfs, and ſo a breach of the feaſt, though after ward, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to do other wiſe) ſuffered themſelues to be killed rather. So do the deuills alſo: they do aſſault the faithfull, on the feſtiuall daies eſpecially; with more and greater tentations, then on the other daies: which is the cauſe, that ſometimes the ſinnes which are comitted on the feaſt, be more heinous, then theother of all the week, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of frailty. For ſome be ſo fraile and feeble, that aſſoone as tentation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, they confent vnto it, and know not howe to reſiſt or with ſtand it. Let the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be of gaming, murmuring, of loſſe of time, of vnſeemly words, and of ſenſuality, they yield
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:181136:213"/>ſtreight, and reſiſt them not. yet there be ſome worſe then theſe, who do ſeek tentations, and do not tarry to be tempted by the deuill; for they themſelues ſeek occaſions to offend God. and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at thoſe times, when we be moſt obliged to to ſerue him: viz, on the feaſt day, or in their Octaues, which were ordeined, that we might haue more time to be emploied in the ſeruice of God, and to ſolemnize them.</p>
               <p>The reaſon then, why a greater feaſt is kept on one holy day, then another, and more to one ſaint, then to another, is; becauſe, one ſignifieth a more higher miſtery then another. The Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of CHRIST, be two high and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall feaſts: yet there is greater ſolemnity obſerued in the firſt, then in the ſecond: for the cauſe aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. The ſame reaſon is of the ſaints. The Catholike Church maketh a greater holy day vnto one ſaint, then vnto another, for that the deeds of one, haue bene greater, then of the other: or for that his eſtate and dignity was greater: or els for that he had done more good in the Catholik Church.</p>
               <p>And for this reaſon the feaſts of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paule,</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> of <hi>S. Laurence</hi> and other like ſaints, be higher, and more principall feaſts, then others, though they which haue the leſſer feaſts, and they who haue the greater, be all in heauen contented, enioyng God in his glory, vnto which he bring vs for his great mercy: <hi>Amen.</hi>

In that place the bleſſed Pope <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> endured very great troubles and afflictions: yet for all that he forgot not to gouern his Church with good and holy aduiſes and counſells, when he could not do any other thing. In that Iſland, he wrote two epiſtles vnto all the faithfull Chriſtians. In the firſt, he commendeth (as hath bene aboue ſaid) the veneration and reuerence, that ought to be vſed toward prieſts, in regard of the high mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery they deale in, conſecrating by their words, and holding in their hands, the moſt Bleſſed Body of CHRIST our Lord.

In this meane ſpace, they were continually imployed in holie excerciſes, as prayer and working, ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the time in all vertuous occupation: and to that purpoſe they had many miſtreſſes, who taught, and inſtructed them without intermiſſion.</p>

               <p>When the glorious virgin was brought vnto the Temple, shee was placed on the firſt aſcending ſtep of the fifteene, while the offring was prepared, that was to be offred with her. The Prieſts went to meet her, and the B. infant, leauing the hands of them that brought her thither, and without the help of any perſon, only fauoured, and ſuſteined by the grace of the holie Ghoſt, began to climb the ſteppes, and went euen to the Altar, without other help, as if she had beene of perfect age. ſo that the prieſts of the Temple, and they that were with her wondred; but yet they reioyced much thereat, hauing knowledg thereby, that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to shew maruaillſe, in the childhood of her, that should be his mother.</p>

This B: virgin remaining there, made a vowe to obſerue virginitie. yet ſome doctors ſay: that her vowe was conditionall, and not abſolute; ſo that we may pyouſly beleeue; that she kneeling on her knees, with her hands, eyes, and hart lifted vp vnto heauen, might ſay theſe, or the like words.</p>

               </p>
               <p>MANY and great were the graces and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours that IESVS CHRIST beſtowed vpon men diſcending from heauen vnto earth; and deliuering them with his owne death from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death; ouercoming thereby him, that had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the world, and then guiding them by his doctrine vnto heauen. Many men acknowledging this good done vnto them by our bleſſes Sauiour, followed him.</p>
               <p>The firſt were the Apoſtles, then the martyrs Confeſſors, prieſts, virgins, wydowes, and maried people; and thoſe that excerciſe themſelues in all vertuous workes.

               </p>
               <p>This comfortable ſaying was heard by S. <hi>Cecilie</hi> a virgin of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was beautifull of bodie, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bloud, and ritch in poſeſſions. Shee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Goſpell, caried it alwaies about her, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding often thereon, and praying vnto God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.

               <p>Three daies before the apointed t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me of the wedding, she faſted, wept, and prayed continuallie, deſiring God to preſerue her virginitie, for that this mariage was not by her deſired; neither should it be by her will, ſince she had giuen herſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to IESVS CHRIST, and offred to him her virginitie. And that her praier might the rather be heard, she deſired the Angells, Apoſtles, martyrs, virgins, and all the court of heauen to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for her.</p>
               <p>The time at laſt being come, that she and <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> were to be priuate in their chamber alone, she ſpake to him after this manner: My honorable Lord, and deare loue: I will diſcouer vnto you a waighty matter; if you will promiſe to keep it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. <hi>Valerian</hi> forth with promiſed, and then <hi>Cecilie</hi> ſaid vnto him: The ſecret is this: I haue an Angell of God in my companie, who is iealous of me, and guardeth my bodie verie dilligentlie.

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:181136:219"/>ſome perſon that thou loueſt in dishoneſt ſort, which is a wrong to me that am thy husband. And if I find it ſo, I wil not faile to kill you both. To this S. <hi>Cicilie</hi> anſwered: If you deſire to ſee the Angell, you muſt be Baptiſed; &amp; beleeue in one God, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and Omnipotent, Creator of heauen and earth. The concluſion of their long ſpeech was: they agreed; that on the next daie <hi>Valerian</hi> should talk with the bleſſed Bishop <hi>Vrban,</hi> who at that tyme ſat in the Chaire of S. <hi>Peter:</hi> and by him <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> (being firſt inſtructed in the faith) was Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>Then returning home, and coming into the chamber, where <hi>Cecilie</hi> was; he found her at prayer and an Angell by her, in the shape of a beautifull yongman, from whoſe face came a glorious bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtnes. The yong man had two garlands in his hand, made of Lillies, and fresh odoriferous Roſes. The one he gaue vnto S. <hi>Cecilie,</hi> and the other vnto <hi>Vallerian.</hi> When he deliuered them he ſaid: I haue brought theſe garlands for you, wrought with flowres gathered in paradiſe; and in ſigne I ſaie true, they will continew allwaies fresh, and ſmell verie ſweet; and maie not be ſeene, but of them, that endeauour to liue chaſt, as you do. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou <hi>Valerian,</hi> haſt giuen credit vnto thy ſpouſe, and haſt receaued the faith of CHRIST: the ſame IESVS hath apointed me to tell thee from him: that demaund what thou wilt, and he will grant it vnto thee.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Valerian</hi> heard this, he kneeled on the ground, and rendred thanckes vnto God, for the great benefitt beſtowed on him, and ſaid: I deſire
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:181136:219"/>this fauour, that my brother <hi>Tiburtius</hi> (whom I loue moſt hartelie) maie be conuerted vnto the faith. I shall not shew the loue that I beare him, if I being now deliuered from the blindnes of Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, wherein I liued, do not help to deliuer him alſo out of it, if it be in my power. To this the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell anſwered, with a cheerful countenance: Since thou haſt demaunded ſo iuſt a thing, God doth grant it vnto thee. And as <hi>Cecilie</hi> thy ſpouſe hath bene the meanes of thy ſaluation, ſo shall she alſo be a meanes for thy brother <hi>Tiburtius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All came to paſſe as the Angell ſaid for <hi>Tibur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming by hap into the chamber, and feeling a ſweet ſmell of lillies and roſes, and ſeing none, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of them, whence the fragrant ſmell came that he felt? <hi>Valerian</hi> told him: that it came from two garlands which he and <hi>Cecilie</hi> had on their heads, and had bene brought vnto them from heauen. <hi>Valerian</hi> took occaſion hereupon to giue him knowledg of IESVS CHRIST, and told him alſo, that he himſelf was Baptiſed. Then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his brother <hi>Tiburtius</hi> to <hi>Vrban</hi> the pope, he inſtructed him in the faith, and Baptiſed him alſo.</p>
               <p>It befell afterward, that the two brethren, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſing themſelues in good works, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in burieng the Chriſtians, that were martyred; information was giuen of them to a gouernor called <hi>Almachius;</hi> who impriſoning them, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting them in diuers manners (as is written in their liues on the 14 of <hi>Aprill</hi>) they were behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the profeſſion of the faith of CHRIST, and S. <hi>Cecilie</hi> buried their bodies.</p>
               <p>After their deaths, the gouernor <hi>Almachius</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,

She confeſſed vnto him the truth: namelie, that all the goods of the two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gentlemen <hi>Tiburtius,</hi> and <hi>Valerian,</hi> were giuen vnto the poore. The gouernour therefore ſeeking a quarrell, and deſiring to be reuenged on her, ſaid in a great rage: I think we shall haue a Chriſtian of you alſo? but I will haue you to ſacrifice vnto the Gods in my ſight; that I maie be witnes, whether you deſerue the ſame punishment, that thoſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren deſerued, and had.</p>
               <p>The officers of the gouernour vrged her to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. to whom she ſaid: Harken to me brethren. You be the officers of the gouernour, and you think it meet, that I should obey his comande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I on the other ſide, think it verie vniuſt in him to comaund me, to ſacrifice vnto thoſe Gods, which be not ſuch indeed; and to leaue of to ſacrifice vnto the true God, that is IESVS CHRIST. Be aſſured, that I will ſuffer and endure, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can be inflicted vpon me, and at the end, rather loſe my life, then do his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The officers made shew of pittie &amp; compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion toward her; ſeing a damoſell ſo yong, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, ſo faire, and gratious, readie to abandon and leaue all theſe, yea life and all, for her faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>They ſaid vnto her: Conſider thy youth and beautie; haue compaſſion on thy ſelf; and change not all other thy good parts, in theſe tender yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, for vntimelie death. The holie virgin ſaid vnto
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:181136:220"/>them: To change earth for gold, is not to looſe, but to gaine. Or to giue a cottage half-ruinated for a houſe built with perles, and pretious ſtones; or a life repleat with troubles and miſeries, which shall quiklie end, for a life replenished with riches and treaſure, that shall endure for euer. Theſe and the like ſpeaches vſed S. <hi>Cecilie,</hi> and her words were of ſuch force, and wrought ſo, that many that were preſent, reſolued to be Chriſtians, and were afterward Baptiſed by S. <hi>Vrban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The gouernor was aſtonied to heare the holie virgin ſpeak, and viewing her angelike beautie, asked what her name was: for till that time, he knew no other name, but only that she was the wife of <hi>Valerian.</hi> She told him that her name was <hi>Cecilie.</hi> and then the gouernour replyed: knoweſt thou not that the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> haue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that the Chriſtians either do ſacrifice vnto the Gods, or elſe that they be put to death? I know it right well ſaid the holie ſaint. What wilt thou then do ſaid the gouernour? I determine to die, ſaid she. For it is farre better to dye for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing IESVS CHRIST, then to liue denying him. Conſider (ſaid the gouernour) that it wilbe beſt for thee, to leaue and forſake this thy oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and to ſacrifice vnto our Gods. S. <hi>Cecilie</hi> ſaid: It were better for thee to open thine eyes, and to conſider, that thoſe, whom thou calleſt Gods, be but ſtocks and ſtones. If thou wilt not beleeue me, touch them with thy hands, or throwe them into the fire; and there will come lime from the ſtones, which maie ſerue to build with: ſo shall there be no deceit in them, as there is nowe.</p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:181136:221"/>
               <p>Then ſaid the gouernour: How should I ſuffer thee to ſpeak ſuch words in my preſence? knoweſt thou not that I haue power to giue thee life, or to take it awaie at my pleaſure? S. <hi>Cecilie</hi> anſwered: thou thinkeſt my words void of reaſon, and I know thy words to be falſe, and no truth in them. <hi>Almachius</hi> ſaid: doeſt thou ſaie <hi>Cecilie</hi> that I ſpeak not truth? The holie virgin ſaid: I ſaie it, and auouch it, in that thou ſaieſt thou haſt authoritie, to giue and take awaie my life. Thou maieſt take life from the liuing, but to giue life vnto the dead, it is moſt cleere and certaine, thou canſt not. So that I maie well call thee the miniſter of death. I wilbe ſuch an officer vnto thee (ſaid <hi>Almachius</hi>) if thou wilt not ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>So when he ſawe she was conſtant and reſolute, and would not ſacrifice, he cauſed her to be put into certaine bathes, which were in her owne houſe, and hauing shut her in one of them, being empty &amp; without water, they made a great fire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which burned a whole daie and a night. The holie ſaint receaued not any hurt thereby; but it ſeemed to her a place rather of pleaſure and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, then other wiſe. when <hi>Almachius</hi> heard thereof, he comaunded one to cut of her head in that place. The hangman gaue her three blowes, yet did he not cut of her head altogether, but left it euen as it was hanging by the skinne.</p>
               <p>The bleſſed virgin being thus wounded, liued three daies, many Chriſtians coming to viſite her. Among theſe were ſome that had receaued the faith by her meanes, whom she ſeing ſorowfull, comforted. They dried vp the bloud that ran from
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:181136:221"/>her wound with napkins, and other clothes; with intent, to keep them as reliques.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Vrban</hi> went alſo to viſite her, and she told him: that she had deſired of God to liue three daies, that she might diſpoſe of her goods, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt him to conſecrate that houſe of hers into a Church. When the three daies were ended, this holie virgin, and glorious martyr (being in prayer) yeelded her bleſſed ſoule vnto God, on the 22 of <hi>Nouember.</hi>

The moſt common receaued opinion is, that this <hi>Clement</hi> (of whom we now treat) was the Pope, and went with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for a time: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he was after the diſciple of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Clement</hi> was not only a man of very holy life, but alſo verie learned; &amp; wrot many things, which haue bene loſt by antiquity of time. There are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant yet his fiue epiſtles: the firſt of which is moſt elegant, being al repleat with learning, and a true Apoſtolicall ſpirite: which ſome of the Popes his ſucceſſors do alleage in many places. He wrot like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Apoſtles, &amp; the eight books called Apoſtolique Conſtitutions; which ordeine, that in the ſeuen regions of <hi>Rome,</hi> should be ſeuen Notaries, to write the deeds and martirdome of the Chriſtians. He commaunded alſo, that vnto them, that were Baptiſed, should be giuen the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confirmation, aſſoone as they had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the principles of the Chriſtian faith. He alſo ordeined; that the Bishops Chaire should ſtand in a publique and eminent place.</p>
               <p>This holy ſaint preached thee word of God with ſuch feruour, and ſo great courage, that manie Gentills &amp; pagans were conuerted vnto the faith,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:181136:223"/>and many that were already conuerted, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the obſeruation of the precepts of the Ghoſpell, did keep alſo and obſerue the counſells thereof.

               <p>This man deſirous to ſee, what the Chriſtians did in their oratories, where they vſed to pray, and whither his wife vſed to go, went thither one time very ſecretly, but by the permiſſion of God, he was ſtrook blind. This blindnes of his body was an occaſion vnto him, that he recouered the ſight of his ſoule. for the prayer of S. <hi>Clement</hi> cauſed the recouery of his corporall ſight; &amp; his holy words and admonitions were the cauſe, that he was Baptiſed, and recouered there with the ſight of his ſoule. <hi>Siſinius</hi> being Baptiſed, many noble men of <hi>Rome</hi> moued by his example, receued the faith. So that for this, and manie other miracles the holy Pope did, he was much malliced by the miniſters of the Idolls, and other lewd people, whom the diuill vſed, as inſtruments and meanes to diſturbe the increaſe of Chriſtianity, and to diſpatch out of the way <hi>Clement,</hi> who did him much ſcath and harme.

They, that accuſed him, ſaid; he brought in a ſtrange relligion, and perſuaded men to adore for God a man, that had bene crucified, and did what he could to annihilate the adoration of the auncient Gods: that he cauſed many maides that they maried not to them, vnto whom they were eſpouſed, making the title of rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, an excuſe and collour for the ſame.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mamertinus</hi> hauing this direction, laboured all that he could to bring <hi>Clement</hi> to ſacrifice vnto the Idolls. and he on the other part, endeuored to drawe him to be a Chriſtian; &amp; to let him knowe, that the banishment, which he was to ſuffer for profeſſing CHRIST, should be vnto him pleaſaunt and acceptable. It pleaſed God to giue ſuch efficacy and grace vnto the words of the holy ſaint, that <hi>Mamertinus</hi> yelded, and shedding many teares for compaſſion of <hi>Clement,</hi> and his vexations, ſaid vnto him: The God, whom thou adoreſt, help thee in this tribulation, which thou art to ſuffer for his loue. Then he prouided him a bark, and of things neceſſary for the voyage, and ſent him into exile.</p>
               <p>There went many voluntarily in the company of the bleſſed Pope. who being arriued, and come in ſaffly vnto the Iſland, found there more then 2000 Chriſtians, who by the ſentence of th'empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, had bene condemned to digge ſtones out of the quarries. Theſe holy confeſſors of CHRIST, among their other molleſtations, had one which vexed them much: in that, their labour being very painfulle, yet wanted they water to drink: and that lirle which they had, they were compelled to fetch
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:181136:224"/>it, two miles of.</p>
               <p>The holy Pope <hi>Clement</hi> moued vnto compaſſion with their intollerable paine and toile, made his praier vnto God, beſeeching him, to haue pity on his people. His praier being finished, he lifted vp his eies (as <hi>Metaphraſtes</hi> ſaith) and ſawe vpon a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hillock a lambe, who held vp his right foot; as though he shewed, where the Water was. S. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was fully perſuaded that the lamb was IESVS CHRIST, becauſe none ſaw it it, but himſelf only. ſo he went to that place, and ſaid: <hi>In the name of</hi> IESVS CHRIST <hi>digge heere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some began to digge on the one ſide, and ſome on the other, and to caſt vp the earth, not in the place where the lambe shewed, but in a place hard by. S. <hi>Clement</hi> himſelf took a ſpade, and making a litle hoale, where the lamb had showen, there ſprang out incontinent a veine of pure and cleare water, which gaue great conſolation vnto the holy ſaint, and to the other Chriſtians; who were much confirmed in the faith, by the ſame. This miracle moued alſo many of the Painims, to go, and heare his doctrine: by which, they were conuerted vnto the true faith.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the number of Catholiks increaſed, and the report of that which happened in the Isla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was ſo ſpread abroad, that it came to the eares of <hi>Traia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> he was enraged therat: and ſent thither a Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour called <hi>Aufidianus,</hi> who put many of the Chriſtians to death. But when he ſaw they died willingly, for the profeſſion of their faith; he thought the beſt way would be to put <hi>Clement</hi> only (as their guide) vnto death: wherupon, he
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:181136:225"/>cauſed him to be apprehended. When he ſawe him to be firme and ſtable in his faith, he gaue ſentence againſt him, that he should be caried into the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yne ſea, and throwne into the ſame, with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor tied vnto his neck.</p>
               <p>The ſighes, the ſobbes, the lamentable voices of thoſe afflicted Chriſtians, cannot be expreſſed, when they ſawe them ſelues depriued of <hi>Clement,</hi> in whom they found refuge and comfort in their labourſome and diſcomfortable life: hauing him, they thought they had a father, and a maſter: euery one found him to be their faithfull frend, and their louing brother, he made much of them all; he inſtructed them all, he gaue help to all, by all the meanes, he could.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians being in this tribulation, (ſeing then, that if they loſt <hi>Clement,</hi> they loſt all theſe things,) beſought God with great inſtancy, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him out of that perill and daunger, or els that they might end their lifes with him. The holy Pope alſo, aggrieued to leaue them in this tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lamented for them, and yet comforted them, in the beſt maner he could. At the very inſtant, that he was to be caſt into the ſea, the people ſtanding on the shore, lifted vp their voices, and cried aloud: Lord IESVS CHRIST, ſaue him: and the bleſſed Pope ſaid: Eternall father receaue my ſoule. This being ſaid: he was caſt into the ſea, where he ended his life, and all the Chriſtians were very penſiue and ſadde.</p>
               <p>Among others, there were two deſciples of the holy ſaint, the one called <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and the other <hi>Phaebus,</hi> who ſaid to the reſt of the Chriſtians: Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:181136:225"/>let vs make our prayers vnto God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeche him through his fauour, to shew vnto vs the reliques of his holy ſaint. This counſell pleaſed them all very well, and ſo they went vnto prayer, &amp; they had not yet finished the ſame, when the ſea began to decreaſe, and to depart away, for the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of three miles from the shore, and was ſo firme, that men might paſſe all that way dryfoot: where they found a chappell builded, in the middeſt wherof was the body of <hi>S.

               <p>This myracle did not only happen at that time, but alſo did befall euery year, for ſeuen daies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in that place: beginning on the day of his martirdome, and enduring for ſixe dayes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

When shee was eſcaped all daunger, and the ſea was riſen to the shore, remembring then that shee had left her litle ſonne behind her, shee showed great ſignes of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and grief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet she knew not what to do, but ranne, now hither, now thither by the ſeashore, and looked about, that at the leaſt, shee might ſee the dead body of her litle infant. but shee could not ſo shee returned home to her houſe ſadde, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue and diſcomfortable, and paſſed all that year in continuall lamentation.</p>
               <p>When the yearly day of the martirdome of this holy ſaint came againe, she made another iourney vnto the ſepulcher: and comyng to the ſame, shee found her litle ſonne ſleeping ſweetly, euen as shee had left him the year before.

Of this bleſſed mother, the patterne of all chriſtian mothers; of this martyr, or, as S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſaith, more then martyr (for she was eight tymes martyred, ſeauen in her children, and once in her ſelfe) the ſame S.

               <p>This <hi>Phlius</hi> hauing knowledg of that, which this wife <hi>Anaſtaſia</hi> did, shutte her vp, and locked her ſtronglie in a chamber of his pallace, ſetting a guard, and watch ouer her, to the end, she should not ſend any help, or relief vnto <hi>Chriſogonus,</hi> as alſo, that the should not haue any ſuſtenance for here ſelf; determining, that both the one, and the other of them might dye by famine. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the bleſſed woman was shut vp in this ſort, yet she found meanes to write a letter vnto <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi> after this manner.</p>
               <p>Vnto the holie confeſſor of IESVS CHRIST, <hi>Chriſogonus, Anaſtaſia</hi> ſendeth greeting. Although my father which begot we was an Idollater yet my mother that bore me (who was called <hi>Fauſta</hi>) was a Chriſtian, and a vertuous chaſte woman. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed me in the Chriſtian faith, euer from my childhood; and after her death, I was maryed vnto a ſacrilegious and cruell man, whoſe bed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie I haue oftentimes refuſed, excuſing it with infirmities, which I deſired God to ſend me for that purpoſe. I ſpent the night and the day in prayer, deſyring my ſweet Sauiour, that I might imitate his bleſſed example.</p>
               <p>This moſt cruell man, after he bath conſumed my patrymonie, amongſt wicked and lewd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, like vnto himſelf, hath impriſoned me, as if I were a malefactor, or a deteſtable offender, and forbiddeth any ſuſtenance to be guie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me, that I may perish, and dye for want of food.

               <p>To the bleſſed martyr and Confeſſor of CHRIST <hi>Chriſogonus, Anaſtaſia</hi> ſendeth greeting. The end of my life draweth neere, vouchſaffe to remember me, and to pray vnto God to receaue my ſoule, when it departeth from my body, ſince for his loue, and the profeſſion of his holie name, I ſuffer all this torment.</p>
               <p>The holie man returned this anſwere. <hi>Chriſogonus</hi> to <hi>Anaſtaſia.</hi> As darknes precedeth and goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore light; ſo after infirmitie enſueth health, and life cometh after death. Proſperities, and aduerſities haue the like, and the ſame endes: therefore let not the heauy and ſorrowfull fall into deſperation; nor the happy, and fortunate be proude, or too much puffed vp.

And indeed, ſuch places, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, are fitteſt for men of noble linage, and ſuch worthie partes as thy ſelf hath; but vpon this condition, that thou wilt worship our Gods.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Chriſogonus</hi> anſwered: I adore one onely God. With my ſoule and hart I reuerence him, and with all externall ſignes and tokens I confeſſe IESVS CHRIST, to be the true God. And as for thy Idolles which be habitacles of diuells and fiendes, I deteſt and accurſe them. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> comaunded that he should be beheadded, and that his body should be caſt into the ſea; and ſo it was done. A prieſt called <hi>zoilus</hi> found his bodie afterward, and buried it honorablie.</p>
               <p>His martyrdome was on the day whereon the Church celebrateth his memorie, which was on the 24. of <hi>Nouember.</hi> on a Tueſdaie, in the yeare of our Lord. 302. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> being Emperour.

And ſo much the more likelie, for that, at that time, that</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xentius <hi>was in</hi> Rome; Maximinus <hi>reſided in</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, <hi>and other citties of the Eaſt, shewing great cruelties againſt the Chriſtians.</hi>

                  <hi>This is ſufficient by waie of aduiſe, but I will call the tyrant, that martyred her,</hi> Maxentius, <hi>as the Author that I follow doth. He recounteth her life in this ſort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT ſuch time as the Emperour <hi>Maxentius</hi> was monarch of the Romane Empire (being on a time in <hi>Alexandria</hi>) he ſet out a publick edict, in fauour of his falſe Gods, and to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt damage he could of the faith, and profeſſion
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:181136:233"/>of CHRIST. For therein he commaunded: that euerie one should ſacrifice to them, and thoſe that diſobeyed, or denied, should be put to death. peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple flocked in great numbers to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from all parts, to obey the Emperous comaundement; euerie one bringing one beaſt or other, (acording to their abillitie) for the ſacrifice. The beaſtes were of ſuch great number, that the Altars ſmoaked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie with the ſacrifices offred vpon them.</p>
               <p>This was verie pleaſing to the Emperour: who yet to encourage others, apointed a ſollemne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of 100 Oxen to be made; which being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be performed, it happened, That a yong da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> borne of the bloud royall, learned in diuers ſciences, and alſo verie beautifull, called <hi>Catherine,</hi> who acknowledged no other God but IESVS CHRIST, deſirous to defend the lawe of her lord and ſauiour, and greeuing that ſo many people should be drowned in Idolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and eſpeciallie, for that the Emperour cauſed theſe people thus to offend, determined to go ſpeak to him, and to reprooue him; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent (if she could poſſiblie) this miſcheif, that it might go no further.</p>
               <p>Departing with this entention from her houſe, well attended by her men-ſeruants, and handmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, she came vnto the Temple, and ſent one to tell the Emperour, that she deſired to ſpeak with him, and he gaue her leaue to come in. S. <hi>Catherine</hi> came into the Temple, and at her entrance, all the people preſent were amaſed, at her wonderfull and Angelicall beautie, as alſo, for her modeſt, and lowelie behauiour. The Emperour wondred alſo, to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:181136:234"/>ſee a yong maid ſo gratious and deſired to heare her ſpeak, that he might know the entent of her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. This render virgin, verie modeſtlie, yet with a Chriſtian boldnes ſaid vnto him:</p>
               <p>O mightie Emperour, it ſeemes to me that thou shouldeſt in thine owne diſcretion, take notice of thine error, and not to ſacrifice in this ſort vnto Idolls, which repreſent vnto thee men ſubiect to many vices. And if perhaps thou doeſt not know, who they were that thou adoreſt enquire of thoſe that can certifie thee, who will tell thee; that they were principall men in the world, that for ſome benefits done in the countrie, where they dwelt, obtained of the people, to haue ſtatues erected vnto them, that their memorie might be preſerued, and that others ſeing them, might be incouraged to do the like deedes, and thereby attaine ſuch like honor, and reputation. But the rude and ignorant people began to call them Gods, and to ſacrifice vnto them as Gods, not regarding that they had beene men. And though in ſome reſpect they were rare, and deſerued honour and regard; yet in many other things, they deſerued reproach and infamie, for that they had bene vitious of life, and wicked.</p>
               <p>Thou (ô Emperour) oughteſt to draw the people from this their error, and blindnes, and not to perſwade them thus to runne further from the light, to the preiudice of their ſoules. Acknowledg the true God, that created thee, and hath giuen thee the Empire, who being immortall, was made man for our ſake, and of his owne will did ſubiect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to dye, that we might be deliuered from death, which oure diſobedience deſerued. This Lord will
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:181136:234"/>not know them that know not him, nor ſuffer them to enter into his kingdome. But thoſe that acknowledg him he rewa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Emperour, hearing the bold ſpeaches of the virgin, ſtood ſtill a while, and could not ſpeak a word for anger: conſidering withall that vnto the reaſons the damoſell alleadged, anſwere could hardlie be made. yet he ſaid vnto her: yong girle, we will firſt end our ſacrifice, and then we will make you an anſwere. withall he commaunded, she should be led vnto his pallace.</p>
               <p>The ſollemnitie of the ſacrifices being ended, the Emperour returned vnto his pallace, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her to be brought before him, he ſaid vnto her. Tell me yong damoſell who thou art? and of the words that thou haſt ſpoken this daie? <hi>Catherine</hi> anſwered: It is well knowne in this cittie what bloud I am of: my diſcent being both from Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and kings. My name is <hi>Catherine:</hi> and I haue ſpent my time in the ſtudie of Rhetorique, philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie and other ſciences; but that which I moſt eſteeme and regard is, that I am come to the kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledg of IESVS CHRIST, true God, and true man; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue taken to my ſpouſe, and he hath ſaid: <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſedome of the wiſe, and refuſe the prudence of the prudent.</hi> for all the wiſdome and prudence of man, compared to that which I haue learned, is nothing worth, and not to be regarded.</p>
               <p>Whileſt <hi>Catherine</hi> ſpoke, the Emperour viewed her, and wondered at her rare beautie, her come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie feature, and force of her reaſons. He thought
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:181136:235"/>her not a woman borne on the earth, but did liken her to one of the goddeſſes, which he, and the other pagans adored. The more he talked with the holie maid, the more he was confounded: for the more ſtronglie she prooued and concluded, that his Gods were diuells, and that IESVS CHRIST was more potent then they, for that the ſigne of the Croſſe made in the ayre, did both feare them, and driue them away. wherefore he douting to be ouercome by her, and put to reproach, determined to ſend for wiſe, and learned orators, to diſpute with <hi>Catherine,</hi> and to conuince her, by their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Emperour himſelf told the ſaint hereof, and in the meane ſpace, cauſed her to be kept in his pallace, vnder a ſtrong guard. This being done, he gathered famous men out of diuers countries: and fiftie ſuch were aſſembled at his pallace.</p>
               <p>They vnderſtanding the cauſe, wherefore they were called, the chief of them ſaid vnto him: Though there be found (o mightie Emperour) women of good intendment, and sharp witt; and though I think this woman maie be ſuch a one; yet vnto vs haſt thou done apparant wrong, ſince thou makeſt ſuch account of her, by equalling her vnto vs, and by thinking that her wiſedome and learning maie be compared with ours. Some of our diſciples maie diſpute with her, though that be alſo ſuperfluous, and more then needeth, for that she hath not the methode to propound, nor order to alleadg, not to deny nor grant. Yea if she ſpeak with a philoſopher that can diſpute with her, she shall not haue a word to ſaie, but will preſentlie shew her ignorance, and yield.</p>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:181136:235"/>
               <p>The Emperour anſwered him: I would not haue you deceiued: I haue ſtudied my ſelf, though not ſo much as you: and as farre as I can gather, I thinke her worthie to be compared to <hi>Plato,</hi> or any other famous philoſopher. Be aſſured; that if you ouercome her, you shall haue victorie, not of a woman, but of another <hi>Plato.</hi> On the contrarie part, if you be ouercome by her, remember, you shalbe vanquished of a woman. If this happen, you shalbe put to great reproach: but if you ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her, you shalbe highlie honored, and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rewarded by me.</p>
               <p>The daie apointed for the diſputation being come, the holie damoſell was called for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but firſt she making her praier vnto IESVS CHRIST, an Angell appeared, who ſaid vnto her: Feare not thou ſpouſe of CHRIST; for vnto thy humane wiſedome, gotten by ſtudie and paines, shalbe adioyned wiſedome infuſed, and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: with which thou ſhalt ouercome thoſe philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and shalt reduce them, and many others to the faith of CHRIST the true God: and ioyntlie with them (though they shall ſuffer before thee) thou shalt be crowned with the crowne of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome. With this the Angell vanished awaie, and <hi>Catherine</hi> was led before the Emperour, the great and famous philoſophers of the gentiles, being on the other ſide againſt her. There reſorted vnto this great meeting an infinite companie of noblemen, and gentlemen.</p>
               <p>The philoſopher that was accounted more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt, turning toward <hi>Catherine,</hi> and, as it were in ſcoffing manner, ſaid diſdainfully vnto her:
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:181136:236"/>Art thou shee, that with ſaucy and malapert words haſt ſo wronged our Gods? yea, ſaid <hi>Catherine,</hi> I am euen shee: yet I do it not with ſaucie, and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The philoſopher replied: If thou haſt read the famous poets, thou shouldeſt alſo haue noted the ſtatelie, and magnificent names that they attribute vnto them; farre different, and more honorable then thoſe that thou giueſt them.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Catherine</hi> anſwered: what be thoſe ports, and what be the names they giue vnto thy Gods? The philoſopher ſaid: <hi>Homer</hi> is one of them, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the moſt glorious, and greateſt. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> alſo, a famous poet, ſpeaking of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Latona,</hi> calleth him potent, that ſeeth and comaundeth mortall men. Theſe by them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, and highlie eſteemed, and called Gods: you cannot shew me that any of them ſaid, that a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified man was a God. To this S. <hi>Catherine</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: It is true, the poets, that thou haſt named, giue vnto thy Gods names of excellencie; yet with all, thou canſt not deny, but many times they lay vpon them moſt hainous crymes, and abhominable deedes.</p>
               <p>Mark what <hi>Homer</hi> (chieif of the poets) ſaith of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Sometimes he calleth him a lyer, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe; then a deceiuer, and that the other Gods haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired to chaine him with fetters; &amp; that if he had not bene certified thereof, he had come into manifeſt daunger. <hi>Orpheus</hi> alſo (who is the other poet thou haſt named) ſaith of thy Gods: that they know not the troubles, and afflictions of men, and when they do know them, they cannot deliuer
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:181136:236"/>them out of them. <hi>Sophocles</hi> alſo affirmeth: that thoſe that adore and do reuerence to the ſtatues and Idolls of many Gods, do euill, and offend gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly. for ſaith hee: there is but one true God (which is none of theſe) who created heauen and earth, and all that is therein.</p>
               <p>Where you ſaie: that IESVS CHRIST cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied whom I adore, is not famous nor knowne of the poets, and ancient wiſe men, this sheweth plainlie your ſmall reading.

That he should riſe againe, and aſcend into heauen, and that he should come at the laſt daie, to Iudge the quick, and the dead.

               <p>The ſame <hi>Apollo,</hi> not vſing his accuſtomed dark manner of ſpeeche, ſaid in plaine words long before it came to paſſe: He that is the light and ſplendor of heauen, he that is God and man hath ſuffred, not in the diuinitie, but in his bodie; he hath ſuffred reproaches, and was buried; he hath shed many teares form his eyes; he fed 5000. men in the wildernes with bread, by the power of God: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe and the like were the words of S. <hi>Catherine,</hi> alleadging the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſentences of the philoſophers, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who contemned the Gods of the Gentiles, proouing how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie it was to good philoſophie, to ſaie there should be many Gods But yet, if it were poſſible that there should be many, <hi>Iupiter, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, Mars,</hi> &amp; the others which the pagans adored were not, nor could not be Gods, for certaine it is that they were men.

               <p>The holie virgin proſecuted her ſpeach, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clated what IESVS CHRIST preached; of his life, his deeds, his miracles: and shewed, how they were all conformable, to the nature of God. This holie ſainte ſpake theſe things ſo diſcreetlie, and eloquentlie, and with ſuch feruencie of ſpirite, that is was moſt euident and apparant, that it was the work of God, and that within her was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, then humane wiſedome.

It cannot be expreſſed how theſe words cauſed the Emperour to ſtorme and rage, which he shewed by this: for without ſtaie, or obſeruing any order of law, or courſe of Iuſtice, or without any examination, he commaunded, there should be kindled a huge fire, to burne them all to ashes.</p>
               <p>The fire being kindled forth with, the wiſemen fell at the feet of S. <hi>Catherine,</hi> and weeping, beſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght her, to praie vnto God for them, that he would pardon the ſinnes they had committed againſt him through ignorance; and they ſaid they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and deſirous, to receaue the ſacrament of Baptiſme. The glorious ſaint reioycing in ſpirite (as we maie well think) to haue gained ſo good a praie, animated them ſaying: Aſſure your ſelues that God will pardon you, ſince that for his ſake, you leaue the earthlie king, and looſe your owne liues.

Theſe words confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the wiſemen exceedinglie; and they often making the ſigne of the Croſſe, and naming IESVS CHRIST, were in this manner caſt into the fire,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:181136:238"/>where they yealded their ſoules vnto God, on the 17. daie of <hi>Nouember.</hi>

               <p>Some Chriſtians came in the euening, to gather together the reliques of the ſaints, and they found their bodies entire, and whole, and not a haire of their heads perished.

               <p>The Emperour was ſollicitous what he should do with <hi>Catherine:</hi> and it came into his head, to deale mildlie, and louinglie with her.

               <p>The Emperour beginning now to shew rigor, and ſeueritie againſt her, cauſed her to be ſtripped naked, which was no ſmalle affliction vnto the modeſt virgin (being ſo honeſt, and shamefaſt) as to be ſeene naked in the ſight of ſo many people. After she was ſtripped, the Emperour commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded she should be beaten with all cruellty; and the officers for two houres together whipped that yong and tender virgin. Her bodie and flesh, which before was as white as ſnow, was altred in coullor, being black and blew, all bathed in her owne bloud. This did ſo pittie the ſtanders by, that many of them wept abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly.

               <p>Then the holie ſainte was taken from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and put into a dark dongeon, a watch being ſet, that none should dreſſe her wounds, nor giue her any comfort, yea he forbad alſo, to giue her any meat.

               <p>Vpon which occaſion, the Emperour with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſembling, and fained ſmile ſaid vnto her: Trulie, thou deſerueſt to be an Empreſſe, for thy excellent parts and rate beautie. The virgin ſaid: It is to no purpoſe to eſteeme or regard temporall beautie,

               <p>This wretched inuention pleaſed the Emperour well, and he commaunded the engine to be made vp within three daies. In that time he laboured to perſwade the holie virgin to leaue her ſtubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not to be ſo obſtinate; but ſeing that he laboured in vaine, &amp; that the engine was now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, he brought the holie ſaint thither, and cauſed the wheeles to be turned in her ſight. She showing no ſigne of feare, he commaunded to tye her to one of the wheeles, to the end, that the other being turned the contrarie waie, might rent her bodie in diuers places, with the sharp inſtruments.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Catherine</hi> was tyed to a wheele, and they laid
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:181136:240"/>their hands on the other wheele, to turne it about; but it fell our farre otherwiſe, then was expected by the curſed wretches: for an Angell of God deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from heauen, who brake the bands where with the virgin was tyed, and she fell to the ground, without any hurt. Then the ſame Angell ſtrook the wheeles, which fell among the pagans, and killed many of them. Thoſe which eſcaped the daunger by running awaie, cryed out with a loud voice: <hi>Great is the God of the Chriſtians.</hi>

The Emperor aſtonied, and almoſt madde with anger, to ſee things go in this manner; in a great rage commaunded the Empreſſe should be put to death. And for that <hi>Purphirius</hi> the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpoke in her behalf, and the Emperour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood he was a Chriſtian, and 200. of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers alſo, he gaue charge they should be all put to death; fullfilling herein, that which this holie ſaint had ſaid before; namelie, that many should be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by her meanes.</p>
               <p>As the Empreſſe was led vnto her death she met S. <hi>Catherine</hi> on the waies, and they embraced affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionatly, requeſting eache other to praie vnto God which they both promiſed; hoping they should shortlie meet together in heauen. The Empreſſe was beheaded on the 23 of <hi>Nouember,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Porphirius</hi> and his ſouldiers. The Emperour being

Before she was beheaded, she prayed vnto God, and yeelded him thancks, for many graces, that she had receiued at his hands; but eſpeciallie for this, which she was at this inſtant to receiue: to wit, the looſing of her life for his ſake, which she took, for the greateſt ſigne of his loue toward her could be.</p>
               <p>She beſought him alſo, that after her death, he would not permitt her bodie, to come into the hands of the perfidious Infidells, leaſt they might reproach, or abuſe it. Moreouer, she beſought him: that thoſe that in their neceſſitie remembred her, might be deliuered from their afflictions, ſo farre forth as was conuenient for them. This praier being finished, one of the ſouldiers cut of her head, and out of the wound came milk, in ſtead of bloud. Then were Angells ſeene, to lift vp her bodie from the earth, who caried it in the ayre vnto the mount <hi>Synay,</hi> and there the ſame Angells bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it. The Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> in proceſſe of time cauſed a ſumptuous Church to be built in the ſame place, and a monaſterie alſo, in which the holie ſaint is honored, and reuerenced.</p>
               <p>Her death was on the 25. of <hi>Nouember,</hi> and on the ſame daie the Catholique Church celebrateth her feaſt, with great ſollemnitie, which is done with good reaſon; for God hath three crownes

               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was borne in the ſame cittie of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and thereof he took his ſurname. For his great vertue and wiſedome, he was elected Bishop, after the death of a holie man called <hi>Theonas.</hi> And as ſome authors ſay; he was the 16. prelate of that cittie, after S. <hi>Mark</hi> the Euangeliſt.</p>
               <p>In the perſecution of <hi>Maximinus</hi> the Emperour great were the troubles he ſuffred; in ſo much as many ſeing, and beholding his patience, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, were ſtirred vp to imitat him: neither did they quaile in the confeſſion of theyr faith, but perſeuered in the ſame, euen to the loſſe of their temporall liues. Although the cruelty, and tyrany of the miniſters in the perſecution, encreaſed daily againſt the Chriſtians, yet the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie Bishop left not of, to look about, and to prouide for the good, and vtillitie of his Church. And whereas the accursed heretick <hi>Arrius,</hi> continued in the ſowing of his cockle, and infernall hereſie, he not only reſiſted him, but excomunicate &amp; ſeparated him, from the congregation, and comunion of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Hauing done this, he was (by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Emperour) apprehended, and put in priſon. And aſſoone as he knew that he was taken, he ſent a comaund vnto the officers to cut of his head. This ſentence being diuulged through the cittie, it was a thing very remarkable, to ſee all the people runne to the priſon (to defend him from
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:181136:242"/>death aſmuch as lay in their power) ſo great was their loue vnto their Paſtor.</p>

There were choſen two prieſts, (the one called <hi>Alexander,</hi> the other <hi>Achillas</hi> to go on that Embaſſade or meſſage; who comming to the priſon where <hi>Peter</hi> was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto him the cauſe of their coming.</p>
               <p>The holie Bishop fetching a great ſigh, made them this anſwere: <hi>Arrius</hi> is already dead in the ſight of God; for that he hath ſo grieuouſly blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed againſt the diuine eſſence; denying that there is one naturality of all the three perſons. <hi>Peter</hi> then took the two prieſts aſide, and ſaid to them in ſecret. Although I be a grieuous ſinner, God out of his mercy hath called me to martyrdome; and I will shew you part of miſtery reueiled vnto me; and I do it the rather, for that you two are to ſucceed me in this dignitie, wherein I now am, the one after the other, firſt <hi>Achillas,</hi> and then <hi>Alexander.</hi>

               <p>I was at my prayers (with great attention) as my cuſtome is; and on a ſo daine, IESVS CHRIST my Lord and God appeared to me, in the likenes of a little infant. The glorie of his face could not be ſeene, ſo great was the ſplendour and brightnes that did proceed from it. He was apparailed with
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:181136:243"/>a long harment, which reached downe to the ground? but it was rent, from the toppe to the bottome, and with his two hands he pulled it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to couer the nakedn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he anſwered me: Thou talkeſt often hereof, but doeſt not endeuour to know it.

This being ſaied; and charging, and enioyning them ſo to do, it being the will of God he diſſimiſſed them, and ſent them away in peace.</p>
               <p>And it happened, that people perſeuering, and awayting at the dore of the priſon; for the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nce of the life of their Paſtor, to auoyd a tumult and the effuſion of blood, the tirannous miniſters of the Emperour gaue direction and order; that in the nigh at, the officers should make a breach through the back ſide of the priſon, and take out of the ſame, the holie Biſsop <hi>Peter,</hi> and to lead him to the place where <hi>S. mark</hi> had before time beene martyred; and euen thus the cruell officers did, and there beheadded him.</p>

               <p>There is no other particuler thing written in the Ghoſpell of S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> though it be very certain, that he was preſent in thoſe things, where it is ſaid, that all the Apoſtles of CHRIST were there, as being one of them. He was preſent at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he was at the entrie in to <hi>Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> on Palme-ſonday: He was at the Supper, where he was made prieſt and Bishop, &amp; communicated. Then with the reſt, he abandoned our Lord, flyeng as the others did: hee ſawe our Sauiour raiſed to life, and alſo aſcend into heauen, and receaued the holy Ghoſt, and his gifts alſo.</p>
               <p>He preached in <hi>Scithia Europea,</hi> which fell to his lotte. He paſſed into <hi>Thracia</hi> &amp; <hi>Epyrus,</hi> in all which countryes, he preached, did myracles, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much people to the faith of CHRIST. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he came to the city of <hi>Patras</hi> in <hi>Achaia,</hi> and there he ſtaied, and made it his place of abode, and reſidence; preaching, and gainyng many ſoules, by conuerting them to the faith, not only in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince and city, but alſo in the countreys adiacent. in a small ſpace there was not ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding one temple of the Idolls, for that they were all turned into Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells, or into oratoryes, where the Apoſtle ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſe, as occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerued. He ordered deacons, &amp; other miniſters to help him in this holy miſterie. Euery one loued &amp; reuerenced him, for that they knew our good God had beſtowed many benefits on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by his meanes. His life was an example to them all: with his words he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted euery one; &amp; his deeds were very gracyous vnto them; for that he healed the ſick, and caſt out the deuills. To euery one he
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:181136:249"/>did good, and did not permitt any to do euill.</p>
               <p>There came into this city as Proconſull, <hi>Egeas,</hi> ſent by the Romaines to gouern that prouince. He ſeing how matters went, began to perſecute the Chriſtians, compelling them to ſacrifice vnto the Idolls. S. <hi>Andrew</hi> came ſayd vnto him: It is good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that thou, who art a Iudg ouer men, shouldſt acknowledge thy Iudg which is in heauen, and honour him, for the true God, as he is indeed, and leaue the honouring of them, who be no Gods. <hi>Egeas</hi> ſaid: perhaps thou art that <hi>Andrew,</hi> who did deſtroy the temples of the Idolls, and perſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade men to receaue the ſuperſtityous ſect of the Chriſtians, which the Romaines haue apointed to be perſecuted, and to be rooted out.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Andrew</hi> replied: The Romaines haue not yet vnderſtood, how the ſonne of God is come from heauen vnto earth, for the ſaluation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; who hath taught, that theſe Idolls be deuills, and deceiuers, who bring men from the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, that they may depart out of this life replenished with ſynne, and be punished in the life to come, with eternall torments <hi>Egeas</hi> ſaid: theſe be the things your CHRIST preached to the Iewes, for the which they crucified him. you ſay true (ſaid the holy Apoſtle) that IESVS CHRIST died on the Croſſe; but that was done by his owne proper will: Howe by his will, ſaid <hi>Egeas?</hi> Is it not knowen, that one of his diſciples ſold and deliuered him into the hands of the Iewes, who preſented him before their gouernour, and he cauſed him to be crucified? All theſe things shew, that he dyed not of his owne will.</p>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:181136:249"/>
               <p>S. <hi>Andrew</hi> replyed: I was and am ſtill his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I auow, that he died by his owne will, for that he knew and ſaid theſe things before, viz: that he should be taken, crucified, and riſe againe the third day: yea and I tell there more, that my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peeter</hi> would haue hindered him, to the end, he should not haue permitted ſuch thing to be done, and was called <hi>Satan</hi> for the ſame: in which he she<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed, that the hinderance of his death was vnto him diſpleaſing.</p>
               <p>And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, that one of vs, that were with him at the table, should betray &amp; ſell him, his beſt beloued diſciple called <hi>Iohn</hi> asked him, who it was, that should be ſo treacherous: &amp; he anſwered that it was he, vnto whom he gaue a ſoppe dipped in the platter; at which word he gaue it to <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was the man that ſold him, and had already bargei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to betray him. by this you may know, that my maiſter who knew all things, might haue preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it: and if he did it not, you are compelled to confeſſe, that he dyed by his owne will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Egeas</hi> ſaid: were it of his owne will, were it by force, I reckon not: but I meruell at thee, that thou wilt worshippe for God, a man crucified. S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> ſaid: very great was the myſtery of the Croſſe, and I will declare it vnto thee, if thou wilt heare me with patience. <hi>Egeas</hi> ſaid: I will hear thee pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently: but after that, if thou doeſt not harken and obay me, I will make thee to feele the miſtery of the Croſſe vpon thy shoulders. Menace not me (ſaid S. <hi>Andrew</hi>) for that: if I feared it, I would not preach the glory therof.</p>
               <p>The firſt man hauing incurred the punishment
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:181136:250"/>of death, for eating the fruit of the forbidden tree it was conuenient, that with the fruit of the tree of the Croſſe, should be cancelled the death of the world, and remedy giuen to the loſſe of mankind. And as the firſt man was formed of the virgen earth, and the ruyne of the world was cauſed by him; ſo it was fitt, that CHRIST should be borne of the imaculate virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> true God, and true man, that he should be the cauſe of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> ſtretched out his armes to gather the fruit of the forbidden tree, and CHRIST ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his out, becauſe they should be nayled to it. <hi>Adam</hi> taſted the fruit, and CHRIST taſted gall. To conclude: I tell thee, that my Lord was clothed with mortall flesh, and would dye vpon the Croſſe, that he might cloth vs with immortality, and giue vs eternall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Egeas</hi> hauing giuen care to the Apoſtle a while, ſaid: Tell theſe thy tales, to them, that will beleeue thee: and beleeue thou me, that if thou doeſt not ſacrifice to our Gods, I will put thee on the Croſſe, thou commendeſt ſo much. S. <hi>Andrew</hi> anſwered: I ſacrifice euery day, to the omnipotent, lyuing, and true God, not the ſmoke of incenſe, nor flesh of bulles, nor bloud of skeep, but the immaculate lamb, in conſecrating his moſt bleſſed body, which being receiued by the faithfull, the lamb remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth intyer and whole, as he was before, although the faithfull do truly &amp; really eate his flesh, &amp; drink bloud. How may that be ſaid <hi>Egeas?</hi> The Apoſtle anſwered: if I should tell thee, and if thou wouldeſt vnderſtand it, it were firſt neceſſary for thee, to be
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:181136:250"/>a Chriſtian. <hi>Egeas</hi> replyed: I shall make thee by force of torments to tell me, howe, and by what meanes I may vnderſtand it.</p>
               <p>Then put he him in priſon, vnto which place reſorted much people, who would haue taken the Apoſtle away violently, if he had not hind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed it: for out of the priſon he preached to them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded them not to rebell againſt the tirant, whoſe cruelty would be vnto him an occaſion of merit. If he shall afflict the body, ſaid the Apoſtle, he hath no power to hurt the ſoule: his torments will quickly end, but the reward shall endure for euer. We ought rather to make much of him, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him, then to vſe him diſpleaſantly, ſince he may do vs much good, and but a litle harme with theſe and the like words the Apoſtle ſtayed the people, from any commocion or inſurrection againſt the Proconſull.</p>
               <p>The next day <hi>Egeas</hi> cauſed the Apoſtle to be brought before him, and ſaid: I am perſuaded thou art now better aduiſed, and wilt fortake thy follyes, which haue darkned thy mynd: and that thou wilt leaue the worship of that thy CHRIST, and enioy the ſweet and delightfull life of this world and auoid withall bitter death. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle anſwered: without the beliefe of CHRIST, there is no true content, nor true life, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preached in this prouince, whither he ſent me, to the end men should leaue and abandon the adoration of Idolls, and receaue the true faith of IESVS CHRIST, and ſo eſcape eternall death, and obteine euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>For this ſame cauſe (ſaid Egeas) I will alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:181136:251"/>thee to adore the Gods, to the end theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom thou haſt deceiued, may forſake the vanity of the doctrine, and returne to the relligion of the auncient Gods. for (as I geſſe) there is not a city in all <hi>Achaia,</hi> but the Temples are abandoned, and thou art the cauſe of it.

But if thou be reſolued to do other wiſe, prepare thy ſelfe to endure and ſupport terrible torments, which shalbe inflicted on thee, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly, thou shalt dy on the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>To this the Apoſtle anſwered: Liſten to me, thou ſon of death, thou dry rotten logge, deſigned to nourish hell fire: hitherto I haue ſpoken myldly to thee, thinking, that thou, being a reaſonable creature, wouldeſt haue made vſe and benefit of my words, and haue forſaken thy falſe and vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Gods: but ſince I ſee thee ſo obſtinate and hard harted, I tell thee plainely, think not to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify me with thy threats. do thy worſt: for the greater the torments be, ſo much more shall the reward be, which IESVS CHRIST will beſtow on me: and the greater shall the paines be, which are prepared in hell fire for thee; where the Gods, whom, at this time, thou adoreſt, shall giue thee thy due reward, tormenting thee eternally. for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they be no other but deuills.</p>

And ſo many were the blowes, they gaue to the Apoſtles body, that it powred bloud out ſo abondantly, that there was not one place free from wounds, from the head to the foote.

Thou haſt more reaſon to fear, for that, if thou doeſt not beleue in CHRIST, thy torments shall differ from myne, for myne shall end in two dayes, and thine shalbe euerlaſting. <hi>Egeas</hi> could keep patience no longer: but comaunded that he should be crucified; yet not nailed to the croſſ with nailes, but bound with cords: which he apointed not for any pitty he had, but to the end the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might continew the longer.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the executioners led him to his martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, an infinite company of people reſorted to him, crieng with a loud voice: What hath this iuſt man, and friend of God done, that he should be Crucified?

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:181136:252"/>made ſo beautifull by the bodie of CHRIST, I haue deſired thee a long time, I haue ſought thee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and now I haue found thee; receaue me in thine armes, and lift me vp from men: preſent me to my maſter, that he maie receaue me by thy mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, who hath redeemed me by thee.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſaid this, and being now neere vnto the Croſſe, he ſtripped himſelf out of his clothes, and gaue them to the officers, who binding him to the Croſſe, lifted him vp, as the ſentence, &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was. There was a great number of people about the Croſſe, all lamenting, and complaining of the cruell, and wrongfull torments that the Apoſtle ſuffred. But he comforted, and encouraged them, to ſuffer ioifully the like torments for CHRIST his ſake, when occaſion was offred.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Andrew</hi> remained two daies on the Croſſe, the people complaining, and criyng out aloud: It is not iuſt, that a man ſo holie, ſo modeſt, of ſo good partes; and that teacheth ſo good doctrine, should die in this manner. <hi>Egeas</hi> vnderſtanding that the people murmured againſt him, fearing ſome tumult, determined to take the Apoſtle from the Croſſe; and for that intent went vnto him.

But if thou come to take me from the Croſſe, it is in vaine, for I am now going to my Lord and king. It ſeemeth I am now before his iudgment ſeat, where I shalbe rewarded, and thou shalt be chaſticed.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſeing that they yet laboured to take
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:181136:252"/>him from the Croſſe, and that the hangman began to vntie him, he lyfted vp his voice to IESVS CHRIST, and ſaid: Lord, I beſeech thee for thy holie names ſake, permitt me not to be taken from the Croſſe aliue. Receaue me my maſter, whom I haue loued, whom I haue confeſſed, whom I haue preached, and of whom I hope to be rewarded. Oh good IESVS, receaue my ſpirit in peace, for now is it time to come to thee, whom I haue ſo much deſired. Whileſt the Apoſtle ſaid theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, there diſcended from heauen a great brightnes in manner of a beame of the ſunne, (which euerie one ſaw) and couered the bodie of the Apoſtle, that for half an houres ſpace it could not be ſeene, at which time it vanished awaye, and then they perceiued that the was dead.</p>

The martirdome of S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> was on the 30. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember,</hi> and on the ſame daie the Church celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his feaſt.

               <p>In the time of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the bodie of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> was tranſlated to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and from thence to diuers other places, till laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, it was carried into <hi>Italie,</hi> to the cittie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malfy,</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> where it is at this preſent.

There was a ſouldier borne at <hi>Toures,</hi> who perceiuing the ſorrow of the people, entred reſolutlie into the middeſt of the fire, and went vnto the place where the reliques of the holie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle were, and brought them awaie ſafe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt. And God was pleaſed to shew, how acceptable this pious deed was to him, preſeruing the ſouldier from the fire, that it hurt him not at all.</p>
               <p>We read alſo of other miracles of S. <hi>Andrew:</hi> as of a Bishop, whom the diuell (in forme of a damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell)

It was no grief vnto the holy damoſell to be ſo shut and mewed vp there, ſince shee might beſtowe her ſelf wholy by this meanes in the ſeruyce of God, as she did; ſpending her time in prayers and meditations: the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the holy Ghoſt recreating her ſoule.</p>
               <p>There was in that ſame tower a faire hall, and many chambers furnished: shee might alſo goe downe from the tower into a garden, for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation: &amp; her father, for her better contentment, made therin a bayne or bathing houſe, with two wyndowes to giue it light. The work was not yet finished, when <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> was occaſioned to go on a long iourney: wherefore he gaue directions vnto the maſter work men, and departed.</p>

               <p>It befell one day, shee meditating the miſteryes of the paſſion and death of IESVS CHRIST; and shedding teares from her beutifull eyes (which like pretious perles, drapped into the fountein, and were mingled with the pure and chriſtalline water) shee came vnto a piller of marble, out of which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:181136:257"/>iſſued, and on the ſame with her finger, shee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the ſigne of the Croſſe: A merueillous thing to recount, the marke made in the marble with the finger of the virgin, continued, as if it had bene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by ſome ſeale into waxe.</p>
               <p>The ſigne remayned there: and after that the holy ſaint was martyred, many came into the baine, and looking on it deuoutly, &amp; calling on the name of the holy Saint, were deliuered from many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes.</p>
               <p>When the holy damoſell had made the Croſſe, shee kiſſed it deuoutly many times, &amp; caſting aſide her eyes, shee ſawe ſome ſtatues of the Idolls, her father adored, which he had cauſed to be ſet there for the more ornament of the place. It grieued her very ſore, and cauſed her to ſigh and lament for compaſſion of them, that adored ſuch Gods: and moued with indignation againſt them, shee ſpit in their faces, ſayeng: Let all them that adore you and ſeek for help at your hands, be like vnto yow: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing done this, shee returned vnto her tower, and ſpent her life in faſting and prayer, her mynd being always fixed vpon God.</p>
               <p>Her father came home, and went to viſite his daughter, and alſo to ſee his newe baine, hauing the maſter workmen with him. When he ſawe, they had made three wyndows (and he had apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, to make but two) he asked them the cauſe therof, and they told him again that his daughter charged them to do as they had done.

               <p>Then he called to remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that many times, when he talked with her concernyng marriage, shee had wished him not to take care for her, for she had no thought of any husband, wherupon he

               <p>It came into his head, that th'emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> perſecuted the Chriſtians, and that in the city was a gouernour, that tormented and put many of them to death: All theſe things together cauſed <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> to be ſo much diſtracted, that being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with paſſion, and forgetting, that he was her father, and taking on him the perſon of a tyrant and parricide, he layd hands on his ſword with a full intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therwith to runne through the breaſt of his owne daughter.</p>
               <p>The holy damoſell, that shee might be reſerued to a more glorious triumph, departed away, and fled from her fathers ſight. By this meanes <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> had ſpace to be aduiſed, that by killing his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he might fall into ſome trouble, and could not juſtify it, if he did not declare and publish the cauſe and reaſon of his doing. he ſtaied not ſo much for any piety, as to haue an occaſion and meanes to be more reuenged on her, and to shewe vnto the other Idollaters, how great his zeale was to the honour of his Gods. Wherfore he took order, that his daughter <hi>Barbara</hi> should be brought before the gouernor <hi>Martianus,</hi> whom he informed, that she was a Chriſtian, and moreouer, he humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him, to proceed againſt her, according to the late decrees of th'emperour.</p>
               <p>The gouernour much wondered at <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo cruelly bent againſt his owne daughter: but he was much more aſtonied, to ſee her Angel-like beauty, which was ſo goodly, that it ſeemed to

               <p>On that ſame night, there was a great brightnes in the priſon, where <hi>Barbara</hi> lay, in the midſt

Theſe words were ſcant ended, when the bleſſed damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell perceued her body to be healed of all her hurts and wounds, which thing did excedingly reioyce her in ſpirite, and for the ſame, shee rendered infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite thanks vnto the higheſt God, for that he vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chſafed to viſite her; as alſo, for that he had healed her in this maner.</p>
               <p>On the next day, the holy virgin came againe before the iudge: he ſeeing her hole &amp; ſound, was amazed therat, and ſo were many other, who had ſeene her the day before, when she was led vnto priſon bruſed and wounded. The gouernor ſaid vnto her: See <hi>Barbara,</hi> howe the Gods haue had compaſſion of thee, and haue healed againe thy wounds, they be ſo deſirous to reduce thee vnto their ſeruice by mildnes. Be not thou vnto them vnthankfull, nor obſtinate in thy errour, leſt thy do hereafter vſe rigour and ſeuerity againſt thee. To this, the holy damoſell anſwered: They who be blinde, as thou art, think as thou doeſt: but I will tel thee the truth how I was healed (if thou deſire to know it) It was IESVS CHRIST the ſonne of the liuing God, whom thou canſt not ſee, thy ſoule being blinded and drowned in the profound darknes of iniquity.</p>

               <p>The tirant not content with this cruelty, but proceeding further, bad them to cut of the nipples of her breaſts, which put her to much paine, but much more was the loue that shee bore vnto IESVS CHRIST, which cauſed her with patience to suffer the paine: for all which reſpect shee ſaid with the prophet <hi>Dauid:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Sabba</hi> was borne in the prouince of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> in a city called <hi>Mutalaſium:</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name was <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the name of his mother was <hi>Sophia:</hi> and it was in the time of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> 2. th'emperour of <hi>Rome.</hi> It fell out, that the father of <hi>S. Sabba</hi> went to ſerue in the warre, that was then in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and recommended his ſonne vnto his brother called <hi>Ieremy,</hi> whoſe wife hated the child, and could not abide to ſee him, but vſed him hardly. This was, in part, the cauſe that <hi>S. Sabba</hi> went vnto a monaſtery, in the which <hi>Gregory</hi> a holy man was Abbot.</p>
               <p>He receaued <hi>Sabba</hi> into the monaſtery, and gaue him the relligious habite: where he liued a holy life, exerciſing himſelf alwayes in vertue, but his abſtinence was moſt remarkable, and his morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was admirable, and ſo was his humility and patience. wherfore God shewed by him ſome myracles, and one in eſpeciall, which befell in that monaſtery, and this it was.</p>
               <p>The baker had one day put his cloths into the ouen (which was ſomewhat hotte) to dry, and forgetting them, put in fire, which already flaming

               <p>Then he asked leaue of his ſuperiour to depart from that monaſtery, and to go into a deſert, where he liued a ſolitary life certaine yeares, and endured many terrible tentations of the deuills.

He depriued it of the ordinary ſleepe, of eating and of apparell, although he did not like to go in ſtayned or ſpotted apparell (as ſome hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits do) but ſuch as was comely and fitting for one of his dignity of function.

               <p>There befell in the country of <hi>Lycia</hi> and in all the Eaſt, a great contagious peſtilence, which kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led very many, and among others within the ſpace<pb n="470" facs="tcp:181136:264"/>of three dayes died both the father and mother of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and he remayned ſole inheritor to all their goods.

               <p>There was in the city of <hi>Patara,</hi> a gentleman of a good houſe, who had bene before time very rich, and nowe was become poore. This man had three daughters, which were of good yeares, and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> was much diſpleaſed, that the thing he handled ſo couertly was made manifeſt; for he deſired to haue had it ſecret: and therefore he asked in way of guerdon of the poore man, to keepe the pleaſure he had done him ſecret: but his requeſt was in vaine. for as long, as the poore man liued (whereſoeuer he went) he published openly this act of the holy ſaint, and other ſuch good deeds done by him to other, although this only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in this place.</p>

To this end, he was embarked, and hauing entred the voyage, the sky being cleare, and the ſea quiet he told the maryners, that shortly there would be a hydeous ſtorme, for he had ſeene the deuill enter in the shippe, with a naked ſword in his hand, menaſſing to kill all the men in the ſame. Shortly after came the ſtorme S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> had foretold: wherefore the Maryners reputed him for a holy man, and being out of hope to eſcape, they reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, requeſting him to pray for them. So he prayed vnto God, and the ſtorme was aſſwaged.</p>
               <p>It befell in the ſame voiage that a maryner men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or dreſſing the ſailes, fell downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aloft into the shippe, &amp; dyed with the fall. All the maryners were ſorowfull for it: S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> prayed for him, and he roſe on his feet, without any hurt. He arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> and viſited the place where CHRIST our Lord was Crucified, his ſepulcher, and the other holy places: and being deſirous to liue reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the deſerts of <hi>Syria,</hi> he had a reuelation from God, commaunding him to returne into his owne country, for he would not haue his ſeruice in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, but in ſome other place. S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> to obey this reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was embarked in another shippe, &amp; the maryners deceitfully carried him toward <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came neere theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, the wynd cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>When the mariners perceued this maruellous accident, they were amaſed, and in great dread, and craued pardon of the ſaint, who returned vnto his monaſtery, wherein he was receaued by the monks, with great ioy: for they were grieued much with the former abſence of their good father and paſtor. S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſtaied with them a good ſpace: but for that they honored him much, and alſo becauſe he knew that God would diſpoſe of him otherwiſe, he determyned to go vnto the city of <hi>Mirrea,</hi> which was the head city of that prouince, being alſo very populous, and S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> thought he might haue liued there vnknowne.</p>
               <p>It came to paſſe, that when as <hi>Nicholas</hi> came into the Citty, therein were aſſembled ſome Bishops of the Citties adiacent, with the cleargie of that citty, to chooſe a Bishop for the ſame, wherefore euery one made their prayers vnto God, to giue them grace, to make a good election: and it was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto one of the Bishops (that was an anciant man, and of good life) that Gods will was; that he, who entred firſt the church on the next day (whoſe name was <hi>Nicholas</hi>) should be elected by them to be Bishop of the citty.

               </p>
               <p>The Bishop looking in his face, thought him to be a perſon worthy of great reuerence: he reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo his name, which was correſpondent vnto the reuelation he had, and ſaid with a ioyfull and chearefull voice: My bretheren come you hither, here is the Bishop: beholde you this <hi>Nicholas:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the man elected by God: they ranne all thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and liking his graue countenance, tolde the people of that had paſſed, and conſecrated him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop (euery man reioycing thereof) ſo that he knew not how to reſiſt them, thinking it to be the will of God, though it was much diſpleſant vnto him, as he declared in his oration, wherein he manifeſted his great humility and ſanctity.</p>
               <p>Aſſoone as <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſaw himſelf a Bishop, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned thus to himſelfe, ſaying: <hi>Nicholas,</hi> this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity requireth another manner of life. Vntill this time, thou haſt liued vnto thyſelf: now, thou muſt liue for the good of other men. The example of life that thou muſt giue vnto euerie one, muſt be ſuch, that thou need not by talk to perſuade thy people to be good. This the ſaint ſaid, and if vntill this time he vſed in his life great mortification, and auſteritie, he afterward much augmented the ſame.</p>
               <p>His appatell was more courſe, he eate but once euerie day, but neuer any flesh, he would haue
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:181136:267"/>ſomething of holie writte read at his table: he ſpent the greateſt part of the night in praier and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſmall time he ſlept he lay on the bare grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: he aroſe before day, and called vp his prieſts, to ſing hymnes &amp; pſalmes in the praiſe our Lord IESVS CHRIST. When the ſonne aroſe, he went vnto the Church, &amp; there he heard diuine ſeruice: the reſt the day he beſtowed in the affaires of his Church.</p>
               <p>He was carefull that in the Churches of his Dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there should be curats borne in the ſame vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or parishe, and that they were alſo learned and vertuous in their lifes: Theſe he aſſembled once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie yeare in the moneth of <hi>September,</hi> and kept a Synode with them, making thoſe ordinances, that were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for the good &amp; profit of his flock, and tooke information of the publick ſinnes, that befell within their charges, and alſo of all needy perſons: and then for the one, and for the other he prouided remedy, in the beſt manner he could. For the relief and helpe of the poore and needy, he would reſort vnto knowen rich frindes which he had, and they gaue almes largely and bountifully: for that the good father in his houſe was verie poore, &amp; after he was Bishop he had not any thing to ſell, nor to lay vnto pledge: the books he had, were borrowed, for he would not haue any thing of his owne.</p>
               <p>For the neceſſitie of ſoules, he had the iudges &amp; magiſtrats on his ſide, who hauing notice of anie publick crime, remedied the ſame. This good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late deſired to do the will of God in euerie thing. Although he was expert &amp; skilfull in the diſpatch

               <p>At that time the two moſt cruell tyrants and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the name of CHRIST, <hi>Maximian</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian</hi> were emperours of Rome, perſecuting the Chriſtians withall extremity, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or by their Iudges. This perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arriued at the laſt, at <hi>Mirrea,</hi> where S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> was Bishop. Firſt they impriſoned the Chriſtians, whom the holie prelate (zelouſlie moued with the honour of God) exhorted and animated, and shewed himfelf a defender of the Chriſtians his ſubiects, and others vnder his charge; both in publique and in priuate, reprouing the tiranny and crueltie of the iudges. whereupon they impriſoned him; but they were not ſo hardy, as to put him to death; douting leaſt the people would make an inſurrection: wherefore they onlie banished him.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> being ſent into exile, he found many Chriſtians, who tooke verie great conſolation at his preſence. The holy Bishop was not idle in that place: yea he ſerued God in the beſt manner he could; no we comforting one, then an other, and exhorting them to ſupport patientlie the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; hold them in their neceſſities to his power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but becauſe God aſſiſted him in his actions, ſome helpe and reliefe he gaue vnto them, for the which he was beloued of all them, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed.</p>
               <p>The furie of that perſecution paſſed away, and

<pb n="479" facs="tcp:181136:268"/>the Catholikes and the heretiks. When the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was ended, S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> returned vnto his Church, and then befell a great dearth.</p>
               <p>At that time a merchaunt had laden ships with wheat in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> intending to tranſport it into <hi>Spaine.</hi> S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> appeared vnto him in his ſleepe, and requeſted him to bring it into <hi>Lycia,</hi> and agreed with him for the price, and in wytnes of the truth, gaue him three pieces of gold in earneſt.

S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> being come vnto the executyon, paſſed through the throng of the people, and comyng to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutyoner, pulled the ſword out of his hand, and then vntyed the three yong men, and taking one of them by the hand, lead them all three away, none of the officers being ſo bold, as to reſiſt him.</p>

                  <hi>Euſtathius</hi> being aſcerteined therof, and hauing a remorce in his conſcience, went vnto S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and kneeling before him, asked him forgiuenes for

               <p>At this, the three captains of <hi>Conſtantin</hi> were preſent: who being returned from <hi>Africa</hi> (hauing archieued th'entrepriſe, for which thy we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If thou doeſt not ſo, as I tell thee; I denounce againſt thee, as a meſſenger from God, moſt dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dly warre, in which shalbe deſtroyed thy nation; and thou, thy ſtate, and family, shall come to vtter ruyne. Th'emperour was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully afeard therat, and ſaid: who art thou, that doeſt menace me thus? The holy ſaint aunſwered: I am <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Myrrea,</hi> and withall vanished away, and went vnto the Iuſtice called <hi>Ablanius,</hi> and threatned him after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>On the morrowe th'emperour, and the Iuſtice mett, and conferred of their viſions: and cauſing the three capteines, which were priſoners, to be brought before them, th'emperour ſaid vnto them: Tell me, haue you any skill in art magick? and they aunſwered no: and wondering at the queſtyon, they demaunded of th'emperour why he asked ſuch a queſtion of them. Th'emperour replyed: By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this laſt night one <hi>Nicholas,</hi> I knowe not what he is, menaced me greuouſly, if I do not ley you go, and diſcharge you. The captaines hearing this, kneeled downe, and kiſſed the ground, and yielded infinite thanks vnto God, and wept for ioy. Th'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour commaunded them to declare this ſecret, and they told him to wit: howe <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſaued the lifes of the three yong knights at <hi>Myrrea,</hi> and how they had recommended themſelfs vnto him, and therefore he was come to help them. Then they declared to feature of the holy ſaint, and th'empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour perceiued, that he was the ſame man, that he had ſeen in his ſleep.</p>
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:181136:270"/>
               <p>Theſe things moued th'emperour to reuiew their cauſe more dilligently, and hauing found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> innocent, he cauſed them, which had accuſed them falſely, to be punished, and delyuered them out of priſon, and he gaue them a book of the Goſpells, written with letters of Gold, and a thurible (or ſenſer) of Gold, and ſaid vnto them: Carry theſe things vnto <hi>Nicholas,</hi> &amp; deſire him not to threaten me, but to pray vnto God for me and my empire.</p>
               <p>The three capteins went vnto the holy ſaint: &amp; when they came vnto him, they fell at his feet, and publiquely told the former hiſtory, and delyuered vnto him the preſent, which the Emperour had ſent vnto him.

               <p>The ſame Authors that write the life of this holy ſaint <hi>Nicholas,</hi> write this ſtory, that enſueth: An army of pagans, being vandalls paſſing from <hi>Africa</hi> into <hi>Calabria,</hi> made great ſpoile in the coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="486" facs="tcp:181136:272"/>Image of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> among other things, fell to the share of one of them, and when he came into his countrey, he asked of certein Chriſtian ſlaues, what that picture repreſented. They told him, that it was the picture of a holy ſaint, called <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who, (though he was dead) did many miracles, and holpe them that were deuoute vnto him.</p>
               <p>This paynime was a vſurer, who had taken a good ſome of mony out of his cheſts; and haſty and important buſines calling him ſudd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the paynime was gone forth, certein thiefs got into the roome, and ſtole away the mony. when the vſurer was returned, and ſawe his mony ſtollen, he ſaid vnto the Image of S. <hi>Nicholas:</hi> Thou haſt kept my mony well indeed <hi>Nicholas;</hi> look to it, and ſee my mony be gotten againe, or I shall caſt thee into the ſite, and burne thee. The thieſs were gone into a ſecret place, to part the mony they had gotten, among themſelfs.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> appeared vnto them, and threatned to punishe them, except they did reſtore the mony vnto the true owner againe: which they (fearing to be diſcouered and punished) did, euen to the value of a peny. When the pagan ſawe this myracle, he was conuerted to the Chriſtian faith, and diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this wonderfull work abroad: and herupon all the Chriſtiansin <hi>Africa,</hi> took great deuotion vnto this gloryous ſaint. To this end did God permit the pagan to do ſuch a thing, which, if it had bene done

The words of <hi>Probus</hi> were not in vaine: for <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vſed that office with ſuch prudence and diſretion, that euery one were very well pleased with his gouernement, and he was alſo eſteemed, and beloued of all men.</p>
               <p>It happened that S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> reſiding in <hi>Millan, Auxentius</hi> an Arryan heretike, and Archbishop of that citty died: and becauſe there was a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, about the election of a new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, (the Catholikes deſiring to haue a Catholike Bishop, and the heretikes labouring to haue an Arrian) <hi>Ambroſe</hi> went thither to quiet the people as a thing belonging to his office, and ſpake to them, bidding them to chooſe them a Prelate, not with vprores and outcries, but with regated to the qualitive of the perſon, and to the conditions fit for ſuch a dignity. Whileſt <hi>Ambroſe</hi> talked thus: a yong child ſaid with a loud voice: <hi>Ambroſe</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop. The people hearing this voice (eſteeming it as the voice of God) was quieted and euery one, as well the Catholikes, as the heretikes, ſaid the ſame.</p>
               <p>The minde of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was not to take this charge on him, and therefore he departed away to
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:181136:274"/>his lodging in the manner of a flight. And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the good opinion of the people from him, and to make them diſlike, he began to execute inſtice with more rigour, then he uſed in former times, and contrary to his milde nature alſo and becauſe that would not ſerue, <hi>Paulinus</hi> ſaith, he made defamed harlots to come vnto his houſe, not to doe euill, but becauſe he deſired to diminish his credit with the people, and to giue them occaſion not to elect him to their Bishop. Neuertheles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery one knew him to be right honeſt of his body, and alſo, becauſe it was knowen to what end he did it, they were more inſtant with him to be their Prelate, crying all with one voice. <hi>Thy ſinne fall vpon v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſeing, that the former dillingences were to ſmall purpoſe, found out another deuiſe, which was: he depatted out of the citty ſeretly to goe vnto <hi>Pauia:</hi> and though he trauelled all the night, yet looſing his way, he found himſelfe hard by the walles of <hi>Milan.</hi> The people vnderſtanding the ſame, tooke him, in a manner, by violence; &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him vnto his houſe; where they ſet a watch vpon him, that he should not fly. Then ſent they vnto the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> to requeſt, that he would confirme the election of <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> The Emperour receiued the embaſſage with great ioy, for it pleaſed him much to ſee, that the iudges which he ſent to gouerne the people, were ſuch, that they deſerued to be Bishops: wherupon forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he confirmed the election, and gaue order, to effect the ſame.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the people vſed this dilligence, S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:181136:275"/>was ſtolne ſecretly gaine out of the citty, and lay hidden at the farme of one <hi>Leontius,</hi> his aſſured friend, and a man of great autority in <hi>Millan.</hi> When the Embaſſadors returned from the Emperor with his conſent, and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was miſſed, a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiture and penalty was imported by proclamation on them, that did not bring him out, if they knew where he was: ſo that <hi>Leontius,</hi> to auoid the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiture, told them where <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was. The people ranne in haſt to the farme, and brought him vnto <hi>Millan,</hi> and then <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> thinking it to be Gods will, agreed vnto the election.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was at that time a <hi>Catechumen</hi> only: and neceſſary it was he should be Baptiſed: and for that the deſired a Catholike Prieſt, this was the firſt thing that made the Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After hee was Baptiſed, he paſſed by degrees, according to the orders of the Church: and on the eight day, which was on the ſeuenth day of <hi>December,</hi> he was conſecrated Bishop, and on that ſame day he was enſtalled. The life of this ſaint was full of good examples. He was very abſtinent: he faſted euery day, except the ſaterday and Sunday: and when the feaſt of any Martir was celebrated; he was very watchfull; and ſpent the greateſt part of the night in prayer: he alſo appointed certaine houres in the day to that vſe: he would alſo be preſent at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice, in his Church; and at the ſame he was very deuout and curious, adding and diminishing many things; ſo that at the laſt, he ordained a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler office for his Church. He compoſed many Hymnes, Antiphonaries, and Reſponſories, ſome of the which are vſed to this day in the Catholike<pb n="493" facs="tcp:181136:275"/>Church.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the diuine office was celebrated, hee would haue all the cleargie very attent, and to vſe deuotion: And to the end, it might be done with more decency and maieſty, he would not permitte that any lay or ſeculer man should remaine among the cleargie, were they neuer ſo great and mighty: yea one time ſeing the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to be place among the Prieſts; he told him, his place was not there, and that the purple garment made him not a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>The good Emperour obeyed, and replied not: yea the zeale and the Chriſtian boldnes of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did ſo pleaſe <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that on a time being in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Patriarch inuited him, to ſit in a ſeat in the quier among the cleargy. The Emperour anſwered; that it was not his place: and that only <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (of all that he had ſeene) deſerued to be called a Bishop, for the zeale he had of Gods honor, and of the reputation of his Church, hauing put him out of that place, whereunto the Patriarch did inuite him: and with theſe words, he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and reprehended the Patriarch.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this holy ſaint was buſied continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in compoſing and writing of the workes, whereof the Church maketh great vſe: all which he wrote with his owne hand; and that he vſed to doe euen vnto his death. He preached alſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily vnto the people, and alwayes he perſecuted the Arrians, vnto whom he was a deadly enemy. He reduced many vnto the faith, and many he wholly conuerted: of whom, one was the great <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who by meanes of his ſermons, and priuate confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:181136:276"/>forſooke the ſect and error, wherein he was drowned, for he could not be called an heretike, bacauſe he was not baptiſed. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> himſelfe did baptiſe him, and at his baptiſme they two did compoſe that can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ambroſe</hi> ſaying one verſe, and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> another, euen to the end thereof. This good Bishop baptiſed many other alſo, and (as S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> ſaith) the only trauell to baptize ſo many people, was ſufficient to hold fiue Bishops in worke.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he was very carefull and dilligent in helping poore men, priſoners, and other needy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The gold and ſiluer which fell to his part of his patrimony (being a great ſomme) which hee had, when he was made Bishop, he beſtowed all, partly in ornaments of his Church, and partly to the poore: for at that time, his mother was dead alſo. He beſtowed the poſſeſſions which remained vnto his Church: vpon this condition; that his ſiſter might haue the profit of them, during her life. He reſerued nothing for himſelfe, that naked and needy, he might the better follow CHRIST, that was poore and needy.</p>
               <p>This holy ſaint was of a noble and gratious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: he laughed and was merry with them, that were merry; and alſo lamented with them that were in ſorrow. When any man confeſſed vnto him any heynous ſinne, he lamented ſo greeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, that he cauſed the penitent to ſorrow, were he neuer ſo hard harted. When he knew of any ſinne out of confeſſion, he vſed great dilligence for thee
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:181136:276"/>amendment, and that he did ſecretly. And many times he obtained his purpoſe, aſwell by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his prayer, as of his mild correction.</p>
               <p>When he heard that any prieſt was dead, (whom he had knowen to be a man ſtudious, and of good life) he receiued great ſorrow thereof: and neuer ceaſed to lament for it. And if he was asked, why he did ſo; he would anſwer, there were two cauſes: the one was, becauſe a man that worthily exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the function of a Prieſt, was hard to be found: &amp; the other was, becauſe he was dead before him. Such was the life of S. <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> and yet there were ſome that perſecuted him. For the Emperour <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> dying, the Empreſſe <hi>Iuſtina</hi> (who was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly an Arrian, &amp; had diſſembled during her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands life) began to diſcouer he venime and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Valentinian</hi> her ſonne, who remained Emperor in <hi>Italy,</hi> being very young: vpon which ground this wicked woman began to perſecute the Catholiks, and ſpecially S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as the chiefe of them.</p>
               <p>One time, there was an election to be made of a Bishop in the Citty of <hi>Sirmium.</hi> The Catholikes deſired to haue one <hi>Annemius</hi> a man of vertuous life to be Bishop: and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> going thither at their requeſt to further it, the election was made accordingly. But becauſe the Empreſſe <hi>Iuſtina</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, laboured that S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> should not conſecrate him, but that an Arrian Bishop should; the people were congregated in the Church for that purpoſe: and on the one ſide ſate the holy ſaint, and on the other ſide ſate the Empreſſe, with many Ladies and damoſels attending on her, with other Courtiers.</p>
               <pb n="496" facs="tcp:181136:277"/>
               <p>The Empreſſe ſaid to her Ladies, that she was heauy to ſee <hi>Ambroſe</hi> do that office: wherupon one of her women, more preſumptuous then the reſt, (thinking to pleaſe the Empreſſe therewith) aroſe and went vnto the chaire of the holy ſaint, with intention to bring him (as it were by force,) vnto the place where the Empreſſe ſate; meaning to vſe ſome violence or abuſe toward him, and to thruſt him out of the Church. The mild Bishop, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience putting the preſumptuous woman fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, ſaid vnto her: Although I be not worthy of this place and office; yet it is not lawfull, to put me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and to detaine me, from laying hands on this Prieſt. Well (ſaid he) take heed, thou beeſt not shortly punished by God. As S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid, ſo it came to paſſe: for on the next day that wretched woman dyed, and the holy ſaint honoured her by accompanying her corps vnto the graue. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, and the other Arrians beholding this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, knew not what to doe: and ſo S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> conſecrated the Catholike Bishop, without any further diſturbance.</p>
               <p>The holy Doctor went then to <hi>Rome;</hi> &amp; as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Marulus</hi> ſaith of him, he lodged in the houſe of a rich man, who boaſted, that in all his life he had receaued no great misfortune of affliction. S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> called his cleargimen, aſſoone as he heard it, and ſaid vnto them: Let vs depart from hence, leſt vnto vs happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome euill with this fortunate man. and aſſoone as he was departed out of the houſe, they ſaw the earth to open, and ſwallow it, and all that was within it.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Rome S. Ambroſe</hi> viſited his ſiſter, and that
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:181136:277"/>damoſell (that kept her company) who now was ancient in yeares. This was that young woman that laughed at him, when he (being a child) did hold out his hand, that she might kiſſe it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto her that he should be a Bishop: and the holy ſaint remembred her of it, when she kneeled downe before him, requeſting that the might kiſſe his hand.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alſo viſited a great Lady (at his ſiſters requeſt,) who deſired him to ſay maſſe in her houſe. The holy man being gone thither, in the company of his ſiſter, (there was brought to him a woman ſicke of the palſy in a chaire,) and shee beſought the holy ſaint to pray for her: which when he had done, the ſicke woman kiſſed his prieſtly garment, and was healed.</p>
               <p>After this S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> returned vnto <hi>Millan,</hi> where the Empreſſe <hi>Iuſtina</hi> perſecuted him gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly, vſing alſo both requeſts, and threats. Then with rewards she laboured to draw the chiefe men of the Citty, yea and the cleargie alſo, as well as lay men, vnto her opinion and partiality, againſt S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> entending to ſend him into exile.</p>
               <p>Matters were ſo prepared and wrought, that a rich man, and mighty called <hi>Eutimius,</hi> (but much more wicked) had prepared a chariot, in the which he purpoſed to ſet S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> by faire, or by foule meanes, and then to carry him vnto banishment. This wicked man had ſo purpoſed, but God diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it otherwiſe: for as <hi>Aman</hi> had made a gibbet whereon to hang <hi>Mardochey,</hi> and was hanged on it himſelfe, ſo <hi>Eutimius</hi> was banished, &amp; caried away in the ſame waggon he had made for S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:181136:278"/>
               <p>This holy ſaint found the bodies of ſome Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs, which were laid in places vncomely and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: therefore he tranſlated them into other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they were laid with more reuerence; as the bodies of S. <hi>Geruaſius</hi> and <hi>Protaſius,</hi> and of <hi>S. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> and <hi>Faelix.</hi> In the tranſlations of theſe ſaints were may miracles done; and many ſicke men hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The Arrian heretiks calumniated the miracles, and moreouer ſaid, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had hired perſons to faine themſelues blind or lame, and that when they came neere to the bodies of the ſaints, they fained to be healed.</p>
               <p>It came to paſſe, that one of the moſt malitious cauillers thereat, was in the ſight of them all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the deuill: who being within him, by the iudgement of God, cauſed him to confeſſe the truth which he denied, when he was in health aſwell in the miracles of the ſaints, as alſo in the miſtery of the B. Trinity, the wretch yelling aloud, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: That, which <hi>Ambroſe</hi> preacheth, is true: and that, which the Arrians teach, is falſe, and vntrue. Then many of the Arrians who by reaſon should haue giuen credit to that apparant teſtimony, came vnto him; and adding euill to euill, threw him into a pond of water, wherein the man was drowned.</p>
               <p>An other obſtinate heretik, which was one of the moſt principall, was conuerted vnto the true faith: And when he was demaunded, why hee changed his faith ſo ſuddainly, he anſwered; he had ſeene an Angell ſpeake in the eare of <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> when he preached; and tell him what to ſay.</p>
               <p>At that ſame time was diſcouered in <hi>France</hi> a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant called <hi>Maximus,</hi> who by a ſtratagem murdered
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:181136:278"/>
                  <hi>Gratian,</hi> who gouerned <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> all the life of <hi>Valentinian</hi> his father. And not reſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therewith: he marched againſt his brother called <hi>Valentinian,</hi> ſonne vnto <hi>Iuſtina,</hi> who then ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Italy.</hi> The young man not daring to oppoſe himſelfe in the field, fled with his mother <hi>Iuſtina</hi> (the mortall perſecutor of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) and came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to demaund ſuccour and ayde of the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius: S. Ambroſe</hi> went vnto <hi>Maximus,</hi> who tooke vpon him the name of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and requeſted the dead body of <hi>Gratiane</hi> to be beſtowed vpon him.</p>
               <p>Strange it was, that although the holy bishop went to talke with him, that was a tyrant; and alſo went for to obtaine a fauour of him; when it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he should haue vſed louely words: yet did he with his accuſtomed, and Chriſtian boldnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue him for his tiranny, and for the vniuſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his Lord. He alſo bad him to do penance for his ſinnes: and becauſe he would not obey, he excommunicated him, and gaue order in all places of his Archbishoprique, where the Tyrant paſſed, that he should not be admitted to heare the diuine office, and commaunded all his prieſts vnder great paines none should be ſo bold to celebrate Maſſe before him, nor to conuerſe with him. But aboue all, he fore-told him, ſaying: that God would cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice him for his rebellion, as afterward it befell for when <hi>Theodoſius</hi> came againſt him, he was ſlaine by his owne ſouldiours.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Maximus, Theodoſius</hi> went vnto <hi>Millan;</hi> and there the Iewes complained of S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> vnto the Emperour, for burning their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:181136:279"/>The Emperour thought S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had done them great wrong, and bad him to reedify it at his owne coſt and charge. After this S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> preached before the Emperour, and reduced to his remembrance all his former life, and told him; he ought to remember, how from a poore captaine who fled thorough <hi>Africa,</hi> for feare to be ſlaine, (which was preſently after the death of <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour) God had aduanced him to be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and beſtowed on him many victories, and therefore he had reaſon to behold and marke well the reward, he should render vnto God in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Synagogue, and cauſing it to be builded for the Iewes, which were enemies vnto God, and all Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>When the ſermon was ended, the Emperour ſaid vnto him: Art thou this day mounted into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit to preach, &amp; ſpeake euill of me in mine owne preſence?

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:181136:280"/>inſtigated by ſome courtiers, (who ſometimes vſe to inſence princes to wrath, when they ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to appeaſe their anger) he altered his minde, and determined to punish the people, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, without courſe of law, or order of Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>And ſo when the people was in the citty, buſy and occupied to ſee the triumphes of that day, the armed ſouldiers, appointed by the Emperour, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, and ſet vpon them: and neither regarding age nor ſexe, maſſacred all that they met, olde and young, little and great, innocent or culpable, Citty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens or ſtrangers: ſo that there were 7000. ſlaine; although it be ſaid, that the Emperour commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there should be but 2000. ſlaine. The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable citty remained moiſtened with the bloud: and all the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> was filled with the report of the cruelty.</p>
               <p>The firſt time, the Emperour went vnto <hi>Millan,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> (vnto whom this cruelty was much diſpleaſant, for the offence committed thereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God) was deſirous to giue remedy to the ſoule of the Emperour, but yet he doubted there might follow ſome ſcandall in reprouing him, on a ſudaine: therefore he iudged it were good to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a while, and withall he would not ſee, nor conuerſe with him: ſo that, when the Emperour approached neere vnto <hi>Millan,</hi> he departed from thence.</p>
               <p>The prudence S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vſed in this caſe, may be an example for other Prelates, how to behaue themſelues with great Princes. And the deſire of a good Paſtor, much moued the mind of S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="503" facs="tcp:181136:280"/>to reduce home this wandering and ſtraying sheepe: yet conſidering, that the Emperour was not of his dyoceſſe, &amp; ſo none of his particuler flock, and douting a greater ſcandall might ariſe; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned, as is ſaid aboue; and departed out of the city: by which he ſtayed himſelf, and refrayned his Chriſtian earneſtnes.</p>
               <p>Th'emperour being come vnto <hi>Millan,</hi> and not finding the good prelate there, shewed himſelf to be diſpleaſed. The holy ſaint wrote vnto him an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; in the beginning wherof, he vſed mild words, and very lowly: but afterwards, he told him in plaine termes, that he was departed, becauſe he would not ſpeake with him: for if he should ſpeake that which was fytt and conuenient, he should be thought to paſſe the bounds of modeſty; and if he should be ſylent not reproue him; he might be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a man, that wynked at notoryous faults, &amp; ſought not to giue due and fit remedy vnto them.</p>
               <p>In the reſt of his epiſtle, he called to his mynd the cruell maſſacre committed at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to do penance, and withall gaue him many good admonitions, and reherſed vnto him many examples. At the end, he ſaid plainly, that he durſt not ſay maſſe in his Church, if he were preſent, and that he had a particuler co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement from God, thus to doe. Then concluded he the epiſtle with theſe words; my Lord, if thou beleeue me, behaue thy ſelf, as I aduiſe thee: and if thou do not beleeue me, pardon this, that I haue done in departing from the city, for I did therin make more account of God, then of thy diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>When S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had written this letter to the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:181136:281"/>Emperour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e thought, that when he had red it, it would haue moued him to penance, and therefore he returned to <hi>Millan:</hi> but yet he would not viſite th'emperour, accounting him as an exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate perſon. The more the holy ſaint eſtranged himſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſight, the more th'mperour thought himſelf bound to ſeek vnto him.</p>
               <p>Things ſtanding in this ſtate it happened, that one day S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was reueſted to ſay maſſe in his Church: and it was told him, that th'emperour was commyng to Church. The good Bishop went to meet him out of the dore, and in the middeſt of all that proud and ſtately company, took him by the purple robe, &amp; with the ſame liberty that he wrote he ſaid to him, in this maner: Stay my Lord: for vnto a man ſpotted and ſtained with ſuch inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine cruelty, and that hath shed ſo much inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, it is not lawfull to enter into a houſe conſecrated vnto God: and leſſe deſerueth he to be partaker of his myſteries, except he do pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce firſt.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, that thou takeſt no knowledg of the ſinne thou haſt committed: and though the fury which drew thee headlong into it be paſt, thou haſt not yet entred into conſideration therof, with the light of thy vnderſtanding, to ſee what a great offence thou haſt committed. I ſuppoſe thy Royall eſtate, and thy Imperiall maieſty do hinder thee, and ſuffer thee not to ſee, and to take notice of thy heynous fault: but look down with thy eies, and conſider, that thou art a mortall man. Take heed leſt thy royall veſture, thou weareſt, do daſell thy ſight, that thou cannot ſee within thy ſelf the fragility of thy flesh, of which thou art formed,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:181136:281"/>as other men are: if thou conſider rightly of thy frailty, think alſo how great and mighty God is, that is the vniuerſall Lord of all.</p>
               <p>Feare him then, for thou art his ſubiect: craue pardon of him, for thou haſt offended him: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou doeſt this, be not ſo bold as to enter into his Church, nor appear in his deuine preſence; leſt thou double thy ſinnes, and prouoke him to more wrath againſt thee. This ſay I on his behalf, and ſo I commaund thee, laying on thee this law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full punishment, by which the Church doth ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all them, which do not make ſatisfaction with due penance.</p>
               <p>Th'emperour gaue eare attentiuely vnto the words of the holy ſaint: and with himſelf conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the maner he had vſed toward him, in telling and reprouing him; and taking it in the beſt part, iudged that he had done with him, as a good prelat should do: and returned to his pallace penſiue and ſad, as they be, which begin a newe to feele the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, which is cauſed by the remembrance of their offences, when they be repreſented vnto a repenting ſoule. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> remained thus certein months, and neuer entred into the Church, ſighing ſecretly, and lamenting for his offence.</p>
               <p>The feaſt of the Natiuity of our Lord approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the generall of his forces called <hi>Ruffinus</hi> ſeeing his Lord penſiue, asked him, what made him ſo diſcontent. Th'emperour fetched a deep ſigh, and shedding teares, ſaid: <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> the cauſe of my grief is this: I ſee other men yea ſlaues and bondmen enter freely into the Church, and houſe of God, and whenſoeuer they come thither, they
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:181136:282"/>find the dore open, and the entrance is denyed only to me: vnto me only is the Church doore shut, and heauen gate alſo. You may go all to the Church to celebrate the feaſt of the natiuity of our Lord: and I wretch being debarred, will remaine here, and lament and weep alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruffinus</hi> vnderſtanding the cauſe of th'emperours ſorowe, ſayd: My Lord, if it shall pleaſe you, I will talke with <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and entreat him to permit you to enter into the Church: for the ſorowe, you haue had, &amp; the teares you haue shed for the euill of which he reproued you, is ſufficient. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> aunſwered: Thy words will do no good: for I know very well his conſtancy in vertue: he is not a man will omit any matters belonging vnto God, for feare or dread of emperiall maieſty, or might.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe words, <hi>Ruffinus</hi> aſſayed how it would proue. And when he treated with S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> he found him ſo conſtant and reſolute, yea ſo ready and prepared to dye, if violence were offred, for the defence of the autority of the church, that he forthwith ſent word vnto th'emperour to ſtay: but he truſting vpon the former words of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffinus,</hi> was comyng toward the Church. When <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> heard this meſſage, he ſtayed not, but went forward, ſaying: I will goe vnto the Church, and there the Bishop shall tell me my fault, and enioine me penance (if he will) as I deſerue.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſtayed for him without the Church: and when the Emperour came, he beſought <hi>S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> in moſt lowly wiſe, to abſolue him: alleadging the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſinned, and yet God pardoned him. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> replied: If thou ſetteſt
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:181136:282"/>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> that ſinned for an example; conſider alſo that he lamented and did penance for his ſinne. The Emperour ſaid againe: I haue ſorrowed very much for the ſame: The ſaid S. <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> This is not ynough, for thou haſt committed a publique offence, and thou muſt alſo doe publique penance. The Emperour ſaid: I will, ſo that shall ſuffice.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid: I would haue thee doe another thing, which shalbe a remedy for thy wrath and indignation, for the time to come; viz. That thou make a law, that when thou, or any other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, commaund any offendor to be put to death forthwith: that the execution be ſtaid, vntill thirty dayes be expired. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was content to doe all, as the holy Bishop willed: and did the penance, with great ſorrow and humility; and alſo made the law, which is extant to this day in the <hi>Codex Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani:</hi> when this was done, he went to the Church.</p>
               <p>I haue ſtayed ſome what long in recounting this accident: aſwell, for that it appertaineth vnto the ſtory of S. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> as alſo, for that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was a Spaniard, and it is fit that the Spaniards should haue knowledge of a man, that was ſo worthy to be Emperour, as <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was: who though hee ſinned, did receiue with ſuch lowelines the correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and penance, impoſed vpon him, by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Bishop.</p>
               <p>Another notable thing happened vnto S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> with <hi>Stilico</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Millan</hi> for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. The caſe was this: Certaine publique bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of beaſts being made in the high ſtreetes, the Gouernour thought the time fit to apprehend one <hi>Creſconius,</hi> who was fled vnto the Church: for he
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:181136:283"/>much deſired to punish him for certaine faultes he had committed. To effect it, he ſent his officers, who came into the Church. and tooke out <hi>Creſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> pulling him by force from the Altar, to which place he was fled for ſuccour. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaw it, but could not help it, for he had but a few Prieſts with him at that time: wherefore he fell on his knees, and wept bitterly for the violence offered to the Church, not being able to remedy the ſame.</p>
               <p>The officers led the man away: and hauing put him ſafe in priſon. came to ſee the ſports, where they found <hi>Stillico,</hi> and certified him of that they had done. They had not yet told all their tale, when two Leopards ſet vpon them, and for all the reſcue and defence that could be made to ſaue them, they tore them to pieces, and put the Gouernor to great feare: who incontinent commaunded the priſoner to be reſtored vnto the Church, and to be ſet free, and he made ſatisfaction for the violence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>Many other things God did by this glorious ſaint: for with his prayers he healed many ſicke men, deliuered many men that were poſeſſed, many were by him conuerted to the faith, and attained vnto ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The fame of this holy ſaint was ſpred ouer all the world, and people reſorted from farre diſtant places to ſee him: as did <hi>Fridigildis</hi> Queene of the Morauians, who was a paynime, and hauing heard marueillous things ſpoken of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be a Chriſtian, went to viſite him, and to craue of him a rule, which she ought to beliue, and how alſo she ought to liue.</p>
               <pb n="509" facs="tcp:181136:283"/>
               <p>The holy ſaint conuerted her, and ſatisfied her in euery point, and eſpecially he appointed her to procure, that her husband should keep peace, and be in league with the Romans. And ſo she depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after she was Baptiſed into her countrey, very well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>The end of the life of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> approched, whereof he had a reuelation long before: &amp; ſo he had found that he should dye about <hi>Eaſter.</hi> Being ſicke in his bed, <hi>Stillico</hi> the Gouernour of <hi>Millan</hi> ſaid; that the death of this man menaced the ruine and deſtruction of all <hi>Italy.</hi> then called he ſome of the chiefe men of the Citty, and bad them to ſpeak vnto S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and to exhort him to pray vnto God for the prolonging of his life, for the great good they receiued by him. The Cittizens went vnto the holy ſaint, and did their meſſage, and hee anſwered: I haue not liued ſo among you, that I should be ashamed to liue, and I haue not ſerued ſuch a Lord, that I should be a feard to dye, and therefore I put my ſelfe wholly into his handes: <hi>His holy will be done</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was now at the point of death, and two deacons, that were in the ſame chamber (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a good way from him) talked to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in a low voice, who should be Bishop after him. One of them ſaid: <hi>Simplician</hi> should be Bishop for that he was a man of very good behauiour, and an Abbot of a monaſtery vnto whom <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> was a verie deare friend. Whileſt they talked, <hi>S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſaid aloud; He is old, but very good. The dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were much aſtonied: ſeing him, to heare their ſpeeches: and after his death, by the relation the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:181136:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>two Deacons made of thoſe his words, <hi>Symplician</hi> was elected Bishop.</p>
               <p>When the holy ſaint was at the laſt point of death, there was in another roume <hi>Honoratus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vercellae,</hi> who heard himſelfe called by one that ſaid to him; Runne, for it is time now: He hearing theſe words, went to the place, where the holy ſaint was; and gaue vnto him the B. Sacrament, which he receiued with very great deuotion. Then laid he is armes acroſſe, and ſaid his prayers; and in ſaying of them, he rendered vp his ſoule vnto God, on the fourth day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord 400. in the raigne of the Emperours <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> after he had beene Bishoppe 20. yeares.</p>
               <p>The Catholike Church celebrateth his feaſt, on the 7. day of <hi>December,</hi> which was the day he was conſecrated Bishop, which is done becauſe thoſe other dayes, for the moſt part, fal in the holy week, or elſe <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His body was buried in the ſame Citty of <hi>Millan</hi> in his Church. God did many miracles by meanes of this ſaint after his death, euen as he had done many whileſt he liued. Let vs all pray vnto God, that by the merits and interceſſion of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> he would make vs partakers of his heauenly glory <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>OVR Lord God hauing created our firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his fauour and friendship, he enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them with giftes and graces naturall and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall. He gaue vnto them the Lordship and dominion ouer all corporall and earthly creatures: he clothed them with originall iuſtice, which was a gift granted not only vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo vnto all his poſterity: he gaue vnto him a moſt bleſſed houſe, which was the terreſtriall paradiſe, a place full of felicity and content.</p>
               <p>And becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> ſeing himſelfe ſo rich and honored, should not haue occaſion to grow inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and proud, he gaue a precept vnto him, (as a paying or owing fee and vaſſellage, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging God for his Lord) which was: he forbad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eate of the fruit of one only tree in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. <hi>Adam</hi> broke the commandement, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him; for the which God did chaſtice him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarly.</p>
               <p>There was a publick act, or arraignement made, in the which were preſent the three diuine perſons Angels, and many other creatures. Before all theſe were <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> brought as publick penitents, in body, with their heads vncouered, and in place
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:181136:286"/>of fetters their guiltines (which the diuines call <hi>Reatus</hi>) which remained in their ſoule after they had ſinned, and was like a cord which tyed them.

               <p>In this manner were our firſt fathers produced, and accuſed before the iudgement ſeat of God: and being examined of their ſinne, <hi>Adam</hi> confeſſed it, yet he laid the fault vpon <hi>Eua;</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed her ſelfe by the ſerpent. The guilty perſons hauing confeſſed their offence, they were ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo, that from that time they began to dye. Their goods were confiſcated, and they thruſt out of the terreſtriall paradiſe: their poſterity were proclaimed Traitors, their diſcendents that were borne of them the children of wrath, and disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of God.</p>
               <p>And wholly to execute the ſentence againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> there was a degradation made of him; for he loſt (as we may ſay) the red or inflamed <hi>Veſtme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> of charity, the <hi>Stole</hi> of immortality, the <hi>Maniple</hi> of original iuſtice, the <hi>Girdle</hi> with which reaſon reſtrained ſenſuality, the white <hi>Albe</hi> of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and the <hi>Amice,</hi> which was as a helmet of fine temper, with which he defended himſelfe from the temptations of the deuill.</p>
               <p>This degradation of the perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> being performed; holy writ ſaith, that God gaue vnto him and <hi>Eua</hi> certaine short garments, which was as the habite of publicke penitents; and from theſe our garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts fetch their originall. It were well that
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:181136:286"/>ſo great regard were not had of thoſe garments, and that men and women were not ſo proud and curious of them.</p>
               <p>This was then the chaſtiſement God inflicted vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> of the which ſome lighteth on his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as this vniuerſall law, that we be all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in originall ſinne, and borne the children of wrath. This law was promulgated in the world three times; firſt in the law of nature; ſecondly in the law written; and thirdly in the law of grace.</p>
               <p>Iob was the trumpet of the law of nature: but firſt preceded the muſicke of the trumpet confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the lawe: for the law was rigorous &amp; the muſicke rigorous, as thonder, ſtormes and thonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts, which fell on his flocks and heards of cattell and killed and conſumed them all. The miſerable man being thus afflicted, and oppreſſed with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite aduerſities and troubles, opened his mouth, and ſaid: <hi>Let the day, wherein I was borne, perish; and ſo let the night alſo, wherein I was conceiued: let that night be turned into darkenes, and be filled with miſery and bitternes.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt ſaith, that <hi>Iob</hi> did not ſinne in ſaying theſe words, whereby it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Iob</hi> did not curſe the day, wherein he was borne, nor the night, wherein he was conceiued: but he curſed the originall ſinne, for that he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſuffered ſo many troubles and aduerſities, becauſe he was conceiued and borne in originall ſinne, which is the fountaine and ſpring of all euils.</p>
               <p>The trumpetter in the law written was <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſaith in one pſalme: <hi>My mother hath conceiued me in ſinnes,</hi> as if he had ſaid: That which I ſay of
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:181136:287"/>my ſelfe, I ſay alſo of all them that are borne, and shall be borne.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in his tranſlation doth not ſay ſinnes, but ſinne; although it be all one, and the ſelfe ſame thing: for the originall ſinne in <hi>Adam</hi> was one ſinne only, and all men commit it in him. This ſinne is called in the plurall number, becauſe it is the occaſion of all the ſinnes committed in the world. The denouncer of this law in the law of grace was S. <hi>Paule,</hi> who writting to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaith <hi>All haue ſinned and haue neede of the grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto we haue shewed the publication of the law: now let vs ſee how it comprehendeth the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; if there be any exempt from it. To this I ſay, that although the ſoule of it ſelfe is not diſtained, becauſe God created it; yet aſſoone as it is infuſed into the body, at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that they be together body and ſoule, that creature is one of the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>per conſequens,</hi> the child of wrath: and is in originall ſinne. Of this IESVS CHRIST was free and cleare for that he was the naturall ſonne of God, and by the ſame, of nature <hi>Impeccable.</hi> He was alſo free of this ſinne, for he that contracteth this ſinne, muſt diſcend from <hi>Adam</hi> by naturall propagation, as to be borne of a woman by the worke of man. And CHRIST though he was borne of a woman, yet was it not by worke of man. So that he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from <hi>Adam</hi> after the corporall ſubſtance, as the diuines ſay, which is the ſame we haue ſaid to wit: that CHRIST was borne of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was conceiued without originall ſinne.</p>
               <p>After IESVS CHRIST, I ſay the ſame of the
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:181136:287"/>B. Virgin his moſt holy mother, that she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued without ſinne: but not for the reaſons ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before of the ſonne; but by grace, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall priuiledge, which it pleaſed God to graunt vnto her. This is confeſſed in celebrating the feaſt of her conception, to wit, that there was not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor inſtant, in which her ſoule was in the disfauor of God: but that aſſoon as she had her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, she was gratious in his eyes, she was faire, and without any ſpot. That this is ſo, may be prooued by many reaſons and congruencies very effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>One is; that of, and from originall ſinne, ariſe two dammages and loſſes, which be the effects thereof. The firſt is, the rebellion which we haue within our ſelfes, making vs to be ſlow and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to doe good, and dilligent to doe euill. This ſaith <hi>S. Paule,</hi> writing to the Romaines: <hi>I feele a law within my ſelfe, I feele a ſubiection, an enemy, who hindereth me, and will not let me doe that, which reaſon willeth.</hi> The other dammage is: that we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to corruption, and to be turned to duſt, after our death. This ſaid God vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> aſſoone as he ſinned: <hi>Thou art duſt, and to duſt shalt thou returne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, theſe being the effects of original ſinne, and not being found in the moſt B. virgin, as indeed they were not, it is a neceſſary <hi>Conſequens,</hi> that there was no ſinne in her. That theſe two defects were not found in her, of the firſt, it is a thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and the doctors confeſſe it, to wit: that in her, that biting dog, who is called by the diuines, <hi>Fomes peccati,</hi> was quite quenched and tied, and therefore she had no inward temptations, but moſt
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:181136:288"/>aſſured peace and quiet, in ſuch ſort, that though she had appetite and ſenſuality, yet did they neuer annoy her, but were alwayes ſubiect vnto reaſon. And hereof it cometh that she committed not any ſinne, either mortall or veniall in all her life.</p>
               <p>She neuer ſpoke idle word, she neuer was wroth (out of reaſon,) no not, when she ſaw her ſonne hang on the Croſſe, and that the officers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſouldiers who ſtood about him, ſcoffed at him, haled him, and vſed reuiling and opprobrious words to him. This would haue mooued any mans hart vnto indignation: yet the B. Virgin was not wroth with them, nor gaue vnto them any euill language, whereby to commit ſinne; and this is the common opinion. We may then ſay that in her was not that ſpot of originall ſinne.</p>
               <p>And that her body was exempt (on the other ſide) from being conuerted into duſt, it is the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Catholicke Church, that her body and ſoule was aſſumpted into heauen. Then if the effects of originall ſinne, which be found in them, that are ſtained therewith, were not in the virgin; it followeth that she had not that ſin, and that her Conception was moſt pure.</p>
               <p>The other reaſon is this; That either God was able to preſerue the B. Virgin from this defect, and would not doe it; or elſe, that he would haue done it, and could not. If you ſay, that he was able to doe it, and that he would not; herein you put want of will to be in God, that he would not doe vnto his mother all the good, that he could: and this you may not ſay by any meanes. Then if we ſay, that he was willing, and could not doe it, in ſaying
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:181136:288"/>ſo, great preiudice is done vnto his omnipotency, yea it is great blaſphemy. Let it be ſaid then, that he was able, and would doe it, and that really he did it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the greateſt dignity, that God could impart vnto a pure creature, was to make her his mother: and this ſo rate and ſinguler gift was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Why then hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſo great a benefite on her, should he deny her the grace of preſeruation, which was fitting and conuenient for her? He exempted and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged her from the paines of child-birth, and from being turned vnto duſt: which be generall lawes: was it not alſo reaſon that he should exempt and ſet her free from originall ſinne? <hi>Eua,</hi> who was the cauſe &amp; occaſion of all our euill (as S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi> ſaith) was created in grace: is it meere then, that <hi>Mary</hi> by whom we haue had ſo great good, should be thought to be conceiued in ſinne? Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer, they which be conceiued in originall ſinne, be called by the Apoſtle children of wrath, and ſlaues to the deuill: and to ſay ſo of the moſt B. vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, is a thing moſt inconuenient.</p>
               <p>Further a good ſonne ought to doe to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the honour, that he can: and in not doing of it, it ſeemeth, he doth not intyrely fulfill the precept of God, to honour his father and mother. Our Lord IESVS is the true Sonne of the glorious Virgin: and it is fit he should do that for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that any other good ſonne would doe to his mother. And though the B. Virgin was preſerued from it, therefore cannot we ſay that CHRIST was not her Redeemer: for that in preſeruing of
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:181136:289"/>her, she was more deeply redeemed: for there be two manners of redemptions, one preſeruatiue, and the other ſubleuatiue, or reſtoring. The firſt is more excellent then the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; for it is euident, that one shall be more obliged and beholden to him that ſuſtaineth him, that he fall not into the durt, and myre; then vnto him, that lifteth him vp out of it, and then wipeth his cloths.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe if God cauſed a Temple to be builded, the moſt ſumptuous and ſtately, that euer any was in the world, wherein to ſet the Arke of the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which (for that it was to conſerue the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the table of the law, and the wand wherewith <hi>Moyſes</hi> did the miracles) was to be couered with moſt fine Gold within, &amp; without, &amp; to be made of incorruptible wood: more iuſt it was that God should giue rare, and ſoueraigne perfections vnto the bowells and wombe, wherein he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe his ſonne, and where his diuinity should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite in a manner ineffable. If God commanded the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be ſanctified, when they deſired to come and talke with him; it shall be then very iuſt, that she who was to be the mother of God, and cloth him with his humanity, should be adorned with ſinguler purity.</p>
               <p>God conſerued the garments and shoes of the Hebrews in the deſert for the ſpace of 40. yeares, ſo that they were neuer torne; which thing he did for his honour: &amp; much more fit was it, he should preſerue the ſoule of his mother, to the end, she should neuer fall out of his fauour, or be without grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſeph</hi> made all the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> tributary vnto
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:181136:289"/>King <hi>Pharao,</hi> except the land of the Prieſts, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that our Lord &amp; redeemer ought to exempt from the tribute of originall ſinne, the B. virgin, with whoſe flesh, the true Prieſt after the order of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lchizedech,</hi> should be clothed. Our holy forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though they ſpoke many great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and praiſes of the B. Virgin, yet ſaid they not that she should not be conceiued in originall ſinne neither hath any ancient Counſell made any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or ſaid their opinion in it.</p>
               <p>This came to paſſe, becauſe God hath not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all thing together at one time vnto his Church nor vnto the faithfull: neither was it conuenient to be ſo. Therefore he ſaid vnto his Apoſtles, after he had declared great matters vnto them at his laſt ſupper, as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> writeth: <hi>I haue many things to ſay, but yet you are not capable of them,</hi> your vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not able to conceiue them, the holy Ghoſt shall reueale them vnto you. This was true, for when the Holy Ghoſt came, he declared all things, that were fit for that time, and continually doth declare, and manifeſt things.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which are now laid open, doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that which was diſcouered before, yet are not all things which were before hidden and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a cloud, diſcouered and opened all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for ſome Counſels of our times doe declare ſome things belonging to faith, which our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers did not. And ſo the ſaying that the mother of God was conceiued without ſinne, was hidden and ſecret many yeares; which was a thing not without cauſe. The reaſon might be this. That the common people was ordinarily ſo deuote to her,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:181136:290"/>that if it had bene published and affirmed in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, when things were not ſo well declared, and when that they which had erred, could not ſo well haue bene inſtructed and reformed, as it is fit they should in ſuch a caſe, it might haue bene that the B. Virgin should haue bene adored for God.</p>
               <p>To auoide this inconuenience, it ſeemeth good reaſon, this ſecret should be kept cloſe. At this preſent time, the Church hath opened this ſecret in giuing leaue that we may hold and beleeue, that the glorious Virgin was conceiued without ſinne. And when the Church graunteth this licence, is it not neceſſary for vs, which be ſo much obliged to her, and trauell to ſerue her, to ſeeke out ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and meanes how it should be? And ſo much the more, for that beſide the former reaſons allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there be many more, which ought to enforce any curious perſon, or man of an indifferent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that though the ancient fathers ſay not in plaine words, that the B. Virgin, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued without ſinne, but rather ſeeme to infer the contrary, for it was conformable to their time: yet is it moſt ſure, that if they had written in our time, they would haue ſaid and written otherwiſe, then that they now write: for all that, I ſay, they all, namely S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> giue a note touching the Virgin, ſaying: that whatſoeuer is honorable and and can be ſaid in praiſe of any ſaint, ought to be attributed vnto her with ſurpluſage and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</p>
               <p>But being ſo, as it is ſaid that many ſaints after baptiſme ſinned not mortally, as <hi>S. Nicholas</hi> S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
                  <pb n="523" facs="tcp:181136:290"/>S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and others: If it be ſaid (which is an Article of the Catholicke faith) that S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> were ſanctified in their mothers womb, it is apparant by the rule giuen, that this, and much more may be ſaid and beleeued of the B. Virgin. Then shee was not only ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in her mothers womb, but alſo preſerued from all ſinne.</p>
               <p>He ſpoke not much from the purpoſe, that ſaid: That when IESVS CHRIST ſaid by S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> that <hi>among the ſonnes of women, there was not a greater aroſe then Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> though the Greeke text ſaith, <hi>no prophet,</hi> yet the Latine text, (from which it is not lawfull to appele,) ſaith: <hi>none borne of a woman:</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the B. Virgin being greater and more holy then <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> (as all confeſſe and graunt) when our Sauiour ſaith none aroſe, she is excepted, for she neuer aroſe becauſe she neuer fell.</p>
               <p>The other reaſon is, the holy Catholicke Church celebrateth the feaſt of the Conception of the B. Virgin, not with the title and name of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of Conception, which was on the 8. day of <hi>December.</hi> And this is not inſtituted for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer Churches to celebrate, but it is inſtituted to be kept generally in all Chriſtendome, ſince the breuiary of <hi>Pius 5.</hi> which is receiued by all the Church.</p>
               <p>Finally I conclude, that among all the feaſts ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniſed of the B. Virgin, none is ſo ſolemnely ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by the faithfull, as this is, and that is done to shew her vertue &amp; nobilitie the more thereby, and in reſpect of the great good which beginneth this day for vs all. Let vs alſo conſider what a great
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:181136:291"/>mayne we should haue had, to haue wanted the glorie that we shall receiue by her company in heauen. And though that the eſſentiall glory of the ſaints proceed from God, yet receiue they alſo a very great accidentall glory from the company of the B. Virgin. for though the eſtate of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome dependeth of the King; yet alwayes, or for the moſt part, particuler feaſts and triumphes, as iuſts, torneys, daunces, maskes, and other pleaſant shewes, are made for the honour of the Queene, and of her Ladies and damoſels. So alſo is it in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but in another manner, it is cleare that there is accidentall glory, with ioyes and triumphes, continually made, for the mother of God.</p>
               <p>But we wretches heere in the world, what should we doe without the glorious Virgin? to whom should we haue recourſe in our troubles and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities? Who should comfort vs? who should giue vs helpe? who will shew themſelues ſo pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and mercifull, as this glorious Virgin, when we call vpon her deuoutely? how great our loſt and dammage should be without this gratious mother, may be known by the great ioy we ought to make this day of her conception, in the which she began to haue her beginning in this world.</p>
               <p>Let vs then reioyce and ſolemnize this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing our ſelues deuout to this B. mother, and her pure Conception; that, as many haue beene fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by her, that haue done ſo, ſome being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from moſt dangerous perills, and others hauing obtained particuler fauours; So wee alſo being deliuered by her meanes from our offences &amp; faults, may merit to obtaine euerlaſting life. <hi>Amen.</hi>

There is extant an epiſtle of <hi>Melchiades,</hi> written vnto the Bishops of Spaine, in the which he sheweth himſelf to be a godly and ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man. In that epiſtle he ſaith: that all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles acknowledged S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be their ſuperior: And by cauſe thoſe Bishops bad moued a queſtion, which was the greater ſacrament, Baptiſme or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation? he anſwered: ſayeng, that Baptiſme is of greater neceſſity; for that without it, none can be ſaued: but that confirmation was of greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for that none giue it, but a Bishop: And then he reciteth vnto them the effects of the one and the other ſacrament. Moreouer he treateth of the great profit the Apoſtles receaued by the comming of the holy Ghoſt, and how great the goods be, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians<pb n="527" facs="tcp:181136:292"/>attaine, by receauing the holy Ghoſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and then in Confirmation.</p>
               <p>In the ſame epiſtle, he ordeined that, which is already aforeſaid: viz: that Chriſtians should not faſt on the ſunday and thurſday, to avoid the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Iewes and the paynims.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melchiades</hi> found in <hi>Rome</hi> many heretiks of the Manichees, againſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ordeined many things apperteinyng to the offerings and other dueties to be done in Church.</p>
               <p>Some Authors ſay, that in the time of this pope was celebrated the prouinciall councell of <hi>Neoceſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> (which is at this day called <hi>Trapezunda</hi>) in which be ordeined ſome things perteyning vnto the ſtate of the Church, conformable vnto that time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly <hi>Melchiades,</hi> hauing gouerned the Church as <hi>Damaſus</hi> ſaith 3. yeares, 7. months, and 8. dayes, &amp; hauing giuen holy orders one time in the month of <hi>December,</hi> and ordered 6. prieſts, 5. deacons, and 11. Bishops, was martyred in the tyme of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Maxentius,</hi> about the year of our Lord 304. Some ſay that <hi>Maximinus</hi> did put him to death: but in my opinion they are deceiued. for that <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> perſecuted the Chriſtians in <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Egipt</hi> and not in <hi>Rome:</hi> for there <hi>Maxentius</hi> always remayned, and vſed intollerable cruelty, vntill the time that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> depriued him of his Empire, and of his life alſo.</p>
               <p>The Church celebrateth the feaſt of this pope on the 10. day of <hi>December:</hi> and his body was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the Churchyard of <hi>Calliſtus</hi> in the <hi>Via Appia</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There is no particuler knowledg of his life (and for what cauſe he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and what he did there) vntill he was Pope: onely it is ſaid, that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> his Predeceſſor being banished from <hi>Rome,</hi> he neuer abandoned him: and he took ſuch kindnes at his charity, and conſolation at his words, that he told him he should be his ſucceſſor in the chaire of <hi>S. Peter</hi> after his death. And that, which the good Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> ſaid, came afterward to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Aſſoone as <hi>Damaſus</hi> was elected Pope, there fell great contention betweene thoſe his electors, and the friends of <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> the deacon. They fell from words to blowes, in the cathedrall Church of <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> ſo that many were wounded, and ſome ſlaine, on both parts. The which (as we may well belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue) happened againſt the will of <hi>Damaſus.</hi> When th'emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> was certified of this vprore and tumult, he took order to diſplace <hi>Vrſicinus:</hi> wherupon <hi>Damaſus</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed peaceably in the Apoſtolik dignity.

               <p>After a few dayes, the faction of <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> ſeing they could not preuaile againſt <hi>Damaſus</hi> this way, ſuborned two lewd men, that were deacons, the one was called <hi>Concordius</hi> &amp; the other <hi>Callistus,</hi> who accuſed the holy Pope of Adultery.

               <p>S. <hi>Damaſus</hi> was a famous Pope, and did many things in the defence of the faith, &amp; in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, for the which he is comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded diuerſly by all the writers of that time. <hi>Theodore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſaith that <hi>Damaſus</hi> was an admirable man, and worthy of ſouerein praiſe, and adorned with the ſplendour of many vertues. S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> writing vnto <hi>Pammachius,</hi> among other praiſes of <hi>Damaſus</hi> ſaith, he was a virgin, as a true Pope of the Church pure, &amp; without ſpot. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Damaſus</hi> was choſen to the papacy, by the ordinance of God. The fathers of the ſixth <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell</hi> call him the Adamant of the faith, for his firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, againſt diuers hereſyes.</p>
               <p>In the time of S. <hi>Damaſus,</hi> was celebrated one of the foure Generall Councells (of the which S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> ſaith: that he reuerenced them, as the foure Ghoſpells) and this was the firſt Councell of <hi>Conſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antinople,</hi> in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In his time was celebrated another Councell at <hi>Aquilegia</hi> alſo. This good paſtor laboured, not only to deſtroy the heretiques and
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:181136:294"/>hereſies, but alſo to take away the abuſes, which had crept into the Chuch: &amp; this was one.</p>
               <p>From the time of the primitiue Church, there was a kind of prieſts, who ſerued in the place, where was fewe people, as in the villages. Theſe kept company with the Bishops, and were called <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> and at that time, they were thought to be conuenient and fit to be there. for a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall charge of the Bishops was, to prouide things neceſſary for the poore, and to diſtribute among them the goods of the Church, in helping the ſick and needy. And bycauſe the Bishop alone could not performe all things with his owne perſon, he had need of ſome others to help him.

And ſo the Church by a publick decree, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined: that the <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> should be taken away, conſidering that our <hi>Lord</hi> IESVS had only Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, whom the Bishops repreſented; and diſciples, repreſented by the prieſts. And that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any ſuch order in the Church, different from others: wherfore the holy Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> in one epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (among many which he wrote)) ſaith: that in the Catholik Church there neither be, nor ought to be any <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> as needfull, yea rather the contrary is true, and the holy Canons are expreſſely againſt them. By this diligence of the holy Pope, grewe in the Church of God, a vniuerſall peace and repoſe,

S. <hi>Lucy</hi> perſwaded her mother, that they might goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and viſite the reliques of the holie ſaint, not doubting: but that by her meanes she might be deliuered from her infirmitie. <hi>Eutitia</hi> was content, and went with her daughter vnto <hi>Catanea,</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſuch manner, as was fit for their degree, and eſtate.</p>
               <p>When they came vnto the ſepulchre of S. <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thata, Lucy</hi> fell to prayer, requeſting the glorious Martir, to obtaine of God by her interceſſion, health for her mother. <hi>Lucy</hi> being thus in prayer, S. <hi>Agatha</hi> accompanied with many Angels appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto her; and with a familier pleaſing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſaid vnto her: Siſter <hi>Lucy:</hi> wherefore doeſt thou demaund that of me, which thou thy ſelfe maieſt giue vnto thy mother? Aske thou this fauour of God: for if he loue me, he loueth thee alſo; and if he will heare my prayers, he wil alſo heare thine: and where I haue giuen my life for his ſake, ſo shalt thou alſo giue thy life for his loue. And if I be the cauſe that the cittie of <hi>Catanea</hi> be famous and and renowned, for that it is washed, and bathed in my bloud, and poſeſſeth my bodie; ſo shall the citty of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> by the ſame meanes, be famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for thee, and thy ſake.</p>
               <p>After this, S. <hi>Lucy</hi> returning, came to her ſelfe (for the viſion had cauſed her, to be in manner of a traunce or extaſie) and found her mother excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioyfull, for that she felt her ſelfe cured; ſo
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:181136:297"/>both of them rendred thankes vnto God, and to the glorious S. <hi>Agatha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then returned they home, and <hi>Lucy</hi> deſired her mother, to permit her to beſtowe the dowrie she would giue her to her mariage on the poore. Her mother anſwered: Good daughter, firſt cloſe vp mine eyes, and then do euen as thou wilt. The holy damoſell replyed: moſt deare mother, I hartilie wish and deſire, that the almoſe to be giuen, be not only profitable to me, but to you alſo; and that of the benefit comming thereby, you may haue chiefe part thereof. If almoſe be giuen after your death, and onlie by my conſent, it will not doe you ſo much good.</p>
               <p>If a man trauell by night in places where he may ſtumble, and dangerouſly fall; he sheweth great indiſcretion, if he carrie a light behind him, when he may carrie it before him, if he will. this world is like a darke night, in which we all doe trauell, and wherein be many places, whereat wee may ſtumble. The good workes we may do, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie almeſdeedes, be like burning torches, which enlighten vs to walke ſecurelie, without danger, or ſtumbling; wee ought therefore to carrie the light burning before vs, for though it be good to leaue almoſe for the poore after ones death, yet it is much better, to giue it them in our life time. By theſe, and other like reaſons, S. <hi>Lucy</hi> obtained leaue of her mother, to beſtowe her whole portion, and dowrie on the poore.</p>
               <p>When he that should haue maried her, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this; he was diſpleaſed, that he had miſſed ſo great ſtore of riches. And remembring (being
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:181136:298"/>himſelfe a Pagan or Infidell) that <hi>Lucy</hi> did theſe good deedes as a Chriſtian, he accuſed her vnto the Gouernour of the Cittie called <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her to be brought before him, vſed all milde perſwaſions he could, to draw her to ſacrifice vnto the Gods. But S. <hi>Lucy</hi> anſwered: To relieue the poore in their neceſſities, is a ſacrifice very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, and this ſacrifice I haue alreadie offred vnto him; now not hauing any more goods to beſtowe, I do heare offer vp my ſelfe, and my life alſo vnto him, being all that I haue to giue.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid the Gouernour: Perhaps the God, whom thou ſpeakeſt of, is CHRIST, who was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Iewes in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> That ſame is he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſaid the holie ſaint. The Gouernour ſaid: How ſtandeth this together? that he being God, should dye ſuch an opprobrious death? The bleſſed Virgin anſwered: It is not meete that your <hi>Iupiter, Apollo, Venus,</hi> or the reſt should be called Gods: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it lawfull for any man to adore them, for they were of lewd and wicked life; ſome of them being Adulterers, manqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>llours, and moſt cruell tyrants. Theſe qualities beſeeme not a God: but to dye as IESVS CHRIST did (whom I confeſſe to be the true God) doth not gaine ſay that he is God, ſince he was made man, that he might dye, and by his death it pleaſed him, to beſtowe life v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon men.</p>
               <p>Thou talkeſt too much ſaid <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> and art too ſaucy: being ſo young: who taught thee to prattle in this manner? The holie damoſell ſaid: The ſeruants of CHRIST shall neuer want an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, when they be brought before Iudges and
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:181136:298"/>Maieſtrates, for ſo much he promiſed vnto them ſaying: <hi>you shall not ſpeake, but the Holie-Ghoſt that dwelleth in you.</hi> The gouernour ſaid: Then thou haſt the Holie Ghoſt. S. <hi>Lucy</hi> anſwered: They that liue in chaſtitie and puritie, be the Temple of the Holie Ghoſt. If it be ſo, ſaid the Iudge, I will driue out the Holie Ghoſt, thou ſpeakeſt of, out of thee. For I will haue thee led vnto the ſtewes, where when thou haſt loſt thy chaſtitie, thou shalt alſo looſe the Holie-Ghoſt, thou eſteemeſt ſo much.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid the holie Virgin: O wretched man! thou are much deceiued: for if thou make me looſe my chaſtitie by force, I shall gaine two crownes in heauen; the one of a chaſt woman, and the other, becauſe I haue beene forced, and for defending my chaſtitie. Then the Iudge ſaid: leaue your words, for we will come to deedes; and then inſtigated by the diuell, he commaunded, that she should be led vnto the brothel-houſe. Many people flocked thither.</p>
               <p>Some intending to ſatisfie their luſt, laid violent hands vpon her, to draw her by force vnto their pleaſures. But God did helpe his handmaid, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her to be immoueable. And though many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to pull her with their hands: yea, ſome with ropes, and laſtlie with many yoake of Oxen, yet could they not draw her one foote out of the place. wherefore the Iudge ſaid: Be theſe thy witchcraftes? that being, as thou art, a ſorrie girle many men, nor many yoake of Oxen cannot ſtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then the iudge commaunded officers to bring ſtore of wood, and to place it about the holie da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell; and that they should powre thereon Oyle, Pitch, and Roſin, and then ſet fire thereto, that she might be conſumed to ashes. The flame did her no hurt, and in the mideſt of the fire she ſaid: My moſt louing and gratious Lord hath granted me a little ſpace in my martyrdome, that the faithfull belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers may be incouraged, and not to feare torments, which be not indeed ſo rigorous, as they ſeeme to be: and that Idollaters may be confounded, when they ſee how little they can doe, againſt the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the moſt high God.</p>
               <p>The Gouernour not knowing what to do more, cauſed aſword to be thruſt through her throat, which wounded her mortallie: but before she died she ſpoke to certaine Chriſtians preſent, (who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to ſee her ſo wounded) and ſaid vnto them: Be of good comfort bretheren: for the Church of God shal haue peace ere long; &amp; the emperours that haue done ſuch damage thereto, shal shortlie looſe the rule, and dominion that they haue. We read alſo, that the Bleſſed Sacrament was brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecretlie by a prieſt; and that when she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the ſame, she ended her life in peace.</p>
               <pb n="541" facs="tcp:181136:299"/>
               <p>Her bodie was buried in the ſame cittie of <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſa,</hi> where it remained many yeares; god shewing diuers fauours and graces to his faithfull ſeruants, by the merits, and interceſſion of the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.

               <p>The Church (beſide all her other merits) hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and accounteth her for aduocate of the eyes, and for the ſight. It is therefore requiſite that we all haue particuler deuotion, and recommend our ſelues vnto her; that God may by her merites, and interceſſion, preſerue our corporall ſight, and grant the light of our ſoules; that we may be able, and worthie, to ſee his diuine maieſtie in heauen <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The life of this bleſsed. Apoſtle is gathered out of the Euangeliſtes,</hi> S. Iſidore, Simeon Metaphraſtes, <hi>and</hi> Gregorie <hi>of</hi> Toures <hi>in this ſort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle was a Galilean: but it is not knowne how, or when he was called to the Apoſtleship. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt maketh of him particuler mention; when <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> ſent to IESVS CHRIST, to tell him that their brother was dead. And when he talking with his diſciples told them: that he would returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iudea,</hi> and the Apoſtles ſought to ſtay his iourney ſaying to him: Maiſter, they would latelie haue ſtoned thee, and wilt thou yet returne amongſt them? he anſwered: there be twelue houres in the day Giuing them to vnderſtand: that ſo many times their harts might be changed, and altred from that they intended to doe. <hi>S. Thomas</hi> ſeing he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go, ſaid to the other diſciples with a ſtout reſolution: Let vs go alſo, &amp; dye with him. <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> in theſe wordes shewed himſelfe to be of a good courage, and that he loued IESVS CHRIST ſincerelie.</p>
               <p>At the euening, after the laſt ſupper, which our Sauiour made with his diſciples, <hi>S. Thomas</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent alſo, and was made Prieſt, and communicated as others did. When our Sauiour made that ſweete and louelie ſermon, ſaying among other thinges: that he went to prepare manſions for them, and that they knew whether he went; <hi>S. Thomas</hi> ſaid to
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:181136:301"/>him:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan</hi> 14.</note> Lord, we do not know whether thou goeſt, how is it poſſible for vs to know the way? After the death of our Lord, and after his reſurrection, yea the verie ſame day he roſe againe, late in the euening, the Apoſtles being aſſembled in the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning parlour, none being wanting but <hi>Iudas,</hi> that had hanged himſelfe, and <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was gone forth vpon eſpeciall buſines;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan:</hi> 20.</note> IESVS CHRIST appeared vnto them, and shewed them his wounds letting them know: that he was the ſame, that had conuerſed with them, &amp; dyed for them, and that he was raiſed againe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Thomas</hi> was returned, the other Apoſtles ſaid to him: O brother; whileſt thou wert abſent, we haue ſeene our Lord and Maiſter, the very ſame whom we ſaw taken in the garden; the ſame that was beaten, and crowned with thornes; nailed, and dead on the Croſſe; whoſe ſide was opened with a ſpeare; that was taken downe from the Croſſe, and laid in his ſepulchre. This our Lord we haue ſeene riſen againe, glorious and immortall. We haue ſeene the ſignes of his woundes, which ſeeme not, as they were, all ſtained with bloud; but they be adorned wonderfullie, they shew as Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and Rubies ſet in Gold; and but euen now, he departed from vs. <hi>S. Thomas</hi> anſwered: It is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redlie ſome fantaſticke viſion: and for my part, I tell you plainlie: that before I shall ſee him with mine owne eyes; and put my hands into his wounds; and my fingers into his ſide; I will not beleeue that you haue ſeene him: or that he is riſen againe. Thus <hi>S. Thomas</hi> remained in his hardnes of heart eight dayes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 27.</note> without relenting.</p>
               <pb n="545" facs="tcp:181136:301"/>
               <p>We may piouſly beleeue, that the Apoſtles, the Maries, and perhaps the Mother of God alſo, ſaid thus vnto him: As it is the ſigne of a light-headed perſon, to credit and beleeue all things he heareth; ſo is it the ſigne of a ſtubborne, and peruerſe mind, not to beleeue that, which ſo many affirme, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie, ſuch people as theſe be. How shall the Iewes (which be enemies to my Sonne) beleeue, that he is riſen againe; if thou, which art an Apoſtle, wilt not beleeue it? Doeſt thou not remember, that he ſaid oftentimes with his owne mouth, that he muſt ſuffer? yea, he named ſome of the torments, which he was to endure: &amp; withall he ſaid, that he should ariſe againe the third day.</p>
               <p>Now: if thou haſt had triall that he ſaid truth in theſe things, why shouldeſt thou thinke that hee lyed in the other? If thou thinkeſt that the Apoſtles and the Maries be deceiued, and that he whom they ſaw is another: be aſſured; that at leaſt I am not deceiued; but that I know him perfectlie well. For I haue brought him forth; I haue attended, and borne him companie, this thirtie and three yeares. Although the reſt should be miſtaken, yet I cannot be deceiued. And I tell thee againe: that my Sonne and thy Maiſter is raiſed to life: and I beſeech thee, not to be obſtinate, or incredulous any more. Theſe and the like words, we may well ſuppoſe, that the glorious Virgin ſaid to <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> who neuertheles, remained in his hardnes, and vnbeliefe, ſaying: If I do not ſee him, I do not beleeue it.</p>
               <p>I know not the reaſon why <hi>S. Cyrill</hi> taketh part and defendeth <hi>S Thomas.</hi> Other Doctors who be of his opinion (as <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi>) ſay: that <hi>S. Thomas</hi>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:181136:302"/>did not ſinne mortallie, in not beleeuing it, allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſome reaſons thus: that although he had told them before, yet they interpreted his words other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and vnderſtood the meaning of them to be: that he should be made King of the Hebrewes, to diliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the ſubiection of the Romaines; and <hi>S.

CHRIST had ſaid; that he muſt riſe againe: and although they did not vnderſtand it well, when he ſpoke it; yet hauing afterward vnderſtood it, and vpon ſuch teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as auouched it crediblie vnto <hi>Thomas,</hi> that they had ſeene him riſen againe; it was iuſt, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that he should beleeue it, and therefore it ſeemeth, that he cannot be excuſed; but muſt needes be in a fault.</p>
               <p>God permitted him to fall into this error, for the good or many men For the article of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection being ſo high and miſticall, and withall ſo important and neceſſarie, it was conuenient that it should be made moſt plaine, and cleare; and that in it should remaine no doubt, which all came to paſſe, by the doubt of <hi>S. Thomas.</hi> Wherefore <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi>
                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:181136:302"/>ſaith: that the obſtinate dubitation of <hi>Thomas,</hi> did vs more good, then the readie beliefe of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen.</hi> The Holie-Ghoſt foreſaw, that there should ariſe the hereſie of the Manichees, who should ſay: that IESVS CHRIST had a fantaſticke bodie; vnto which <hi>S. Thomas</hi> anſwered by his doubting; that he lyed like a falſe heretike, ſince he made experiment with his owne hands; and ſawe, and acknowledged, that he had a bodie as we haue; yea, after the reſurrection. And if another heretike would ſay: that he roſe not againe verilie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. <hi>S.

Now that I haue taken away all doubts thereof, let no man make any more queſtion of this matter.</p>
               <p>Eight dayes being paſſed, after the reſurrection of our Sauiour, he appeared another time vnto the Apoſtles, <hi>Thomas</hi> being alſo with them. Firſt, he ſpoke thoſe louing words of peace to them, which he ordinarilie vſed after his reſurrection: then he turned toward <hi>S.

               <p>There is mention made of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> another time in the Ghoſpell of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> when <hi>S. Peter</hi> tooke certaine of the Apoſtles to fish with him, one of the which was <hi>S. Thomas.</hi> They laboured all night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any fish, and in the morning our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our appeared to them on the banke, and bad them caſt their nets on the right ſide of the boat: which when they had done, they tooke a great multitude of fishes: and brought them to the lande, where they ſaw our Lord IESVS;<note place="margin">

Peter.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no more particuler mention made of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> in the Ghoſpell, yet it is very certaine, that he was prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at all thoſe things, at which the Euangeliſts report all the Apoſtles of CHRIST, to haue bin preſent. He was preſent therefore, when CHRIST aſcended into heauen: before, and at the laſt ſupper, and at the comming of the Holy Ghoſt.
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:181136:303"/>When the Apoſtles made the diuiſion of prouinces wherein they should preach, the countrie of <hi>India</hi> fell to the lotte of <hi>S. Thomas:</hi> but before he went thither, he preached to the Parthians, Medians, Perſians, Brachmans, Hircanians, and Bartrians: in all theſe places he reaped much fruit, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the holie faith of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Iohn Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith: that <hi>S. Thomas</hi> Baptiſed the three Kings or wiſe men, which came to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thleem,</hi> to adore IESVS CHRIST; and that then he went into <hi>India,</hi> into which countrie he entred verie poore and humble, with his haire long, and curled vp, a pale face, a weake and feeble bodie, that he ſeemed to be but the shadow, or picture of a man; and that he wore a Garment all torne. In this manner the holie Apoſtle came among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, preaching to them IESVS CHRIST in their owne language, diſgracing the Gods, which they adored, the principall whereof was the Sunne. Then did he ſome miracles; and, by little and little, the people drew to him, and forſooke their falſe Gods, and were Baptiſed.</p>
               <p>Then he came to the Cittie of <hi>Calamina,</hi> where the King of that Barbarous nation kept his Court. And although the Apoſtle did ſome miracles in his preſence, in confirmation of the doctrine he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: The king, in ſtead of receauing his doctrine, and to be enflamed with the loue of IESVS CHRIST, as others, and many of his ſubiects had done: was mooued to fierce indignation againſt the Apoſtle, for that he ſaid the Sunne was not God, but tho workemanship of God: and that a man was of more dignitie, then the Sunne, a man hauing the
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:181136:304"/>vſe of reaſon, which the Sunne had not. The king cauſed many torments to be giuen him. among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers this was one: they put many plates of Iron vpon his naked skinne, and then caſt him into a burning ouen.</p>
               <p>But ſeing this did him no hurt at all, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he should be led to a Temple of the Sunne, where was the ſtatue of braſſe, and he willed him to adore it. The Apoſtle fell on his knees, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought God to breake that ſtatue, that the people, (ſeing the ſmall force of their God) might be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and forſake the errors, wherein they were enwrapped. The Apoſtle hauing finished his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the ſtatue fell on the earth, into diuers pieces. The miniſters of the Idols being preſent, and ſeing all this; enraged with furie, they ran the Apoſtle through with Launces, and killed him. His bodie was buried in the ſame Cittie of <hi>Calamina,</hi> and was after tranſlated to the citty of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> where (as <hi>S Gregorie</hi> of <hi>Toures</hi> ſaith) was built a ſumptuous Church, in which God shewed many miracles, by the merits of his holie Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>The death of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> was on the 21. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and on the ſame day the Church celebrateth his feaſt. This was in the yeare of our Lord. 75. in the raigne of <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> Beſide the afore-rehearſed things, there are recounted of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> many other, which be taken for vaine, and Apocripha and this is one: that he was brought from <hi>Ceſarea</hi> euen to <hi>India,</hi> to build a Pallace, and that great ſtore of treaſure was giuen him to build it. The king de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from thence for two whole yeares, and the Apoſtle giuing all the mony to the poore; the king
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:181136:304"/>at his returne, put him in priſon, that he might g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is ſaid alſo, that <hi>S. Thomas</hi> being inuited to a mariage, whileſt he dyned, an Hebrew woman ſong certaine verſes in the praiſe of God; and the holie ſunt ſtayed, contemplating the words which she ſaid: Wherefore one of them that wayted at the table, ſeing he eate not, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe thinges thus reported, giue teſtimonie what they be, as hauing no great foundation, nor good authoritie for them. Yea, this eſpeciallie, of the hand and the dogge, was inuented by heretiks, who mingled this tale, in the life of this ſaint, and holie Apoſtle, to the end, reuenge, curſing, and wishing euill vnto our neighbour, should be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teda thing lawfull. Anf if any should iudge this to be euill, that then the Apoſtle; should be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo alſo: and by this meanes, he should looſe his credit, and authoritie. I maruaile, that of this holie ſaint, who was ſo ſlow in beliefe, ſuch vnlikelie, and vnprobable tales should readilie be beleeued of him.</p>
               <p>Alſo, I do not know of what credit it is, that is ſaid in ſome Cronicles of him, as of his being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord of the countrie, that is now called <hi>Preter Iean,</hi> where they ſay, his bodie is kept
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:181136:305"/>till this day. We read alſo of a thorne, that beareth grapes on <hi>S. Thomas</hi> day, of which as made muſte, or ſweete wine, and they celebrate Maſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. I thinke, he that will auouch this for true, had neede to haue greater authorities, then the places where they be written.</p>
               <p>Howſoeuer theſe things be, this which I now ſay, is moſt certaine: that <hi>S. Thomas</hi> was carried to the paſſage, and death of the glorious Virgin, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as the other Apoſtles. And for that when he came thither it was the third day, after the death of the bleſſed mother of God, and that her bodie was alreadie buried, (God willing it ſo,) he was deſirous to ſee it. The Sepulchre being opened, the bodie was not found therein, for that it was raiſed againe, and was aſſumpted into heauen, as is ſaid in the ſollemnitie of the feaſt of her Aſſumption.</p>

                  <hi>we read one moſt notable in the book of kings, of the woman</hi> Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, <hi>the hosteſse of the prophet</hi> Eliſeus. <hi>Of her it is ſaid: that she had a little child, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, which she tenderlie loued. This child being one daie abroad in the field with his father, complained of a great
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:181136:305"/>paine in his head: whereupon, his father cauſed him, to be carried home vnto his mother, in whoſe preſence the child dyed. The woman felt as great grief, as might be, for the death of her child: and going to the prophet</hi> Eliſeus, <hi>fell at his feet, weeping and lamenting; shewing by outward ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the inward ſorrow of her hart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The prophet hauing compaſsion on her, ſent with her his ſeruant</hi> Giezie, <hi>and gaue vnto him his staffe, to laie it on the dead bodie of the child, which was cold as Iſe. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant did as he was apointed: but the child by that meanes was not raiſed to life. The afflicted mother returned vnto the prophet, and ſo much her praiers, and ſuit preuailed, that she brought him in perſon vnto her houſe. The prophet entred into the roome where the child laye, and shut the dore cloſe; and after he lay flat on the bodie of the litle infant, vſing this dilligence: he laid his face on the face, his hands on the hands, and his feet on the feet thereof. Then he cryed aloud ſeuen times, and the child beginning to be warme, opened the eyes, and recouered life. This being done, the holie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet restored him vnto his mother, who receaued him with more ioye and gladnes, then can eaſilie be expreſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though (as it be ſaid before) that this indeed be a true hiſtorie, which happened really; yet was it a liuelie patterne of the high and maruailous miſterie, that God wrought, in being made man. For the woman</hi> Sunamite, <hi>is a figure of the Church: who hauing a litle ſonne which is mankind; aſſ one as he was created, and put into the pleaſant field of Terrestriall paradiſe, felt a paine in his head; for from thence iſſued fumes of deſire, to be like vnto God. This was our forefather</hi> Adam, <hi>who dyed of this infirmitie, when he eate the fruit of the forbidden tree, whereby mankind be came cold, froſen and without the grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The miſerable afflicted</hi> Sunamite <hi>went for help vnto
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:181136:306"/>the prophet, for the holie Church did continuallie beſeeche God, to giue remedie for this great loſse. The diuine maieſtie had compaſsion on her, and ſent</hi> Giezi <hi>with his staffe, which were the two lawes, the law of nature, being figured in</hi> Giezi, <hi>and the law written, figured in the staffe of the prophet. This yet raiſed not againe the dead child to life, nor gaue remedie vnto the loſse, the world had: as S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, wryting vnto the Hebrewes of the law writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the law reduced not things vnto perfection, nor gaue not full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie vnto our loſses. Yet the Church ceaſed not to deſire God more inſtantlie, vntill he came in perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the world, &amp; was incloſed in the ſecret chamber, of the bowells of the moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed virgin. He entred in, and shut the dore fast, leauing it ſealed, with the virginall ſeale. There that venerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that Gyant, that could not be comprehended, neither in heauen nor on earth, lay flat on the humanitie, took it on him, conioyning face vnto face, hand on hand, and feet with feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All this God did, in conioyning vnto him humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in hipoſtaticall vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then mankind began to waxe warme, to open the eyes; and was reſtored to life; and ſo holie Church remained glad and well content to ſee that, she had ſo long praied for; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. The glorious virgin was replenished with great ioye, ſeing her ſonne, and the ſonne of God alſo in her armes, as she ſawe him, this daie of his birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This hiſtorie is recounted by the Euangeliſt</hi> S. Luke <hi>in this manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE was a proclamation and decree made by the Emperour <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus,</hi> (called <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uianus</hi>) wherein was commaundement giuen, that all the ſubiects of his empire, should go vnto that
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:181136:306"/>cittie, which was the head of the places, where they dwelt, and there they should regiſter their names, and pay a certaine piece of mony; confeſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their ſubiection vnto the Romane empire. This <hi>Octauianus</hi> being Lord of almoſt all the world, he was thus cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ious, deſiring to know exactly, how many people were vnder his ſubiection; peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then generally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uer all, which laſted ſixe yeares before the birth of CHRIST, and ſixe yeares after. This decree was published in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where <hi>S. Ioſeph,</hi> with his bleſſed ſpouſe the mother of God did then dwell; and this happened in the laſt mouth of her being with child. And for that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was of the houſe, and familie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> he was to goe to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> both to pay the mony, and to be inrolled; to which place alſo all other of that linage went.</p>
               <p>The deliuerie of the bleſſed Virgin being neere at hand, although she was not bound to go thither (for the decree did not oblige any but men) yet would be haue with him. God had giuen to him in charge that moſt pretious treaſure; and he thought it not fit, to truſt any other perſon with her; nay, loth he was, to be depriued of ſo great a good, as to be preſent at the birth of the Sonne of God, not onlie to adore the Sonne, but alſo to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the mother. All this came to paſſe by the apointment of God, to the end, IESVS CHRIST should be borne in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and ſo the propheſies of him be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>If we conſider this well, we shall ſee, that the birth of our bleſſed Sauiour in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> came not ſo to paſſe, becauſe the Prophets had foretold it, (though it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, their propheſies should
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:181136:307"/>be accomplished) but rather they ſaid ſo, becauſe God had determined he should be borne there. This mooued almightie God, to chooſe ſo poore and abiect a place, for the birth of his ſonne, agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that he ſaith by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Eſay:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. <hi>55</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>My wayes be not as yours be; my wayes be of one ſort, and yours be of another.</hi> Men ſtriue and deſire, to be honored, and eſteemed: and they ſeeke all meanes that may bring them to eſtimation in the ſight of men; and auoid all things that may hinder them thereof. To be borne of Noble bloud, and a rich houſe, pleaſeth all, and euerie one ſeeketh it; but God doth the contrarie. He came to manifeſt his glorie to the world; and when he should be borne, he choſe not to that purpoſe the glorious Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi> much leſſe the royall Cittie of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> but the little village of <hi>Bethleem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was not pleaſed to be borne in the houſe of men, but in the ſtall of beaſts. And his birth being ſo honored by the Angels, and his death ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious in the companie of theeues; hee couered his honors in the cottage of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his reproaches in the Cittie of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> giuing vnto vs hereby a notable example of humillitie. O happie <hi>Bethleem!</hi> O fortunate ſtall! that pleaſed the Lord of heauen more, then the ſtatelie Capitall of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the rich pallaces of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Thus we ſee, how God choſe <hi>Bethleem,</hi> to giue vs an example of true humillitie, and therefore the prophets wrot it; and they hauing written it, it was conuenient that it should be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Holie <hi>Ioſeph</hi> (as is ſaid) went vnto <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and tooke with him the moſt bleſſed Virgin. It cannot
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:181136:307"/>be expreſſed, what troubles the holie damoſell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by the way? not for her being with child, (which annoyed not her, as it doth other women) but becauſe it was midwinter, when there be ſno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, Ice, winds, and tempeſts. If men in their houſes doe often feele them, much more muſt a young and tender Virgin, trauailing at ſuch a time, and being but meanly appointed, as may well be preſumed; her husband <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and she being but poore. If in their iourney on the way they had toile and trouble, when they came vnto <hi>Bethleem,</hi> they had little refreshing: for the chambers were taken vp, and filled with the great concourſe of people, that came vnto that towne for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The good <hi>Ioſeph</hi> demaunding for a lodging, was anſwered, that they were all full; ſo hee ſeeking, and enquiring further, the ſame anſwer was made him as before. Hereupon the good old man with the holie Virgin, ſeing they could haue no lodging, got them vnder a shead, or penthouſe, where alſo was a ſtall for beaſts. We may well thinke this good couple shed teares, to ſee themſelues in ſuch a miſerable ſtraite plight. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had with him two beaſts, as is gathered out of the prophet <hi>Abacuc,</hi>

<pb n="558" facs="tcp:181136:308"/>the mother of God to ryde.</p>
               <p>At that time was the ſolſtice of winter, when the Sunne beginneth to riſe vpon our hemiſpheare and maketh the day to increaſe.

The holie Virgin. (as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> affirmeth) had not that delight, in the conception of the redeemer of the world; and therefore she had not ſorrow, and paines. Moreouer, it was not fitting that shee should ſuffer paine, that brought forth the ioy and comfort both of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>The ſacred Virgin was aduiſed of that houre, by new ioy which she felt in her ſoule, euen as her virginitie, and puritie deſerued: and it being now midnight, all creatures, after their trauaile, were at their reſt, and vſuall repoſe. The Moone shewed clearlie (the Sunne enuying her, himſelfe being abſent) and she attended on that miſterie, with her bright beames. The ſtarres that ſtraved in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of heauen, deſired to ſtay, to ſee that great, and

All things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yea nature it ſelfe ſtood aſtonied and amaſed, beholding this ſtrange manner of deliuerie.</p>
               <p>The happie houre being come: the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin lifted vp her hands and eyes vnto heauen, and ſaid: Behold O father eternall; the time is come, that thy only begotten Sonne is borne, &amp; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious treaſure is giuen vnto the world, to pay the debt it oweth thee. I offer vnto thee, that art the giuer of all good things, this fruit of life, gathered out of the tree of my bowels. I offer alſo vnto thee this pretious pledge, which thou gaueſt me, and which vntill this time I haue faithfully kept. The bleſſed Virgin ſpeaking theſe or the like words, she felt in her ſoule an vnſpeakable content, and caſting downe her eyes, she ſaw the Sonne of God, and her Sonne alſo newly borne. Forthwith she kneeled downe before him, and shedding teares for tendernes and ioy, adored him, and rendered thankes to him, that he was made man, and that he had elected her to be his mother, yet kept her a moſt pure Virgin, as she was before her deliuerie.</p>
               <p>Then tooke she him in her armes, and ſaid vnto him: Oh the moſt tender, and deare Sonne of my bowels; how can I now cherish thee? With what shall I couer thee, to keep thee from cold, which is thy firſt torment? Thou didſt determine to be made man, wherefore didſt thou chooſe ſo poore a mother? Were there not in the world many great Ladyes and Queenes, that could better haue bene
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:181136:309"/>able to haue clothed thee in ſilke and gold, as thou doeſt deſerue, being God as thou art? I can giue thee but meane, and courſe clothes. But ſince it was thy pleaſure to chooſe ſo poore a mother, why wouldeſt thou be borne, in ſo baſe, &amp; abiect a place? If thou haddſt bene borne in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where thou waſt conceiued, I could yet ſomething better haue attended, and ſerued thee in my poore houſe: but what can I do heere my deareſt Sonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou my God haſt deliuered me, from the panges and throwes, that other mothers endure in childbirth: why wouldeſt thou permit me, to feele now this torment? I meane, to ſee this heauenlie viſage, (on which the Angels, and all the Court of heauen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to gaze, as in a mirrour) to looke ſorrowfully with the cold.</p>
               <p>Oh my Son! how is the ioy that I haue to haue brought thee forth, and to ſee my ſelfe thy mother, mingled with griefe, that I haue not where withall to attend, and cherish thee as I would? If not as thou deſerueſt, yet at leaſt as thou haſt need. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee therefore my deere Sonne, that ſince it is thy will to chooſe me for thy mother, that thou wilt ſupplie our wants: ſo that, to my will, which to thee is beſt knowne, and manifeſt, there may be no want, which my be for thy ſeruice. We may imagine the bleſſed Virgin ſaid ſuch like words, either outward and openlie, or at leaſt inwardly in her ſoule. Then againe adored she the infant as her God, and kiſſing his face as of her ſonne, and his feet, as of the creator, lapped him in thoſe clothes, which she had.</p>
               <p>Although the Euangeliſt had not ſaid as he did,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:181136:309"/>yet we might well beleeue, that the holie Virgin was prouided according to her abillitie, and was not negligent in that caſe, eſpecially she knowing the time of her deliuerie to be at hand. Hauing then wrapped, and ſwathed him, she laid him vpon a little haye in a manger, as the Euangeliſt ſaith in theſe words: <hi>She brought forth her firſt begotten Sonne,</hi>

               <p>Very fit it was, that thoſe bleſſed ſpirits should accomodate and applie themſelues vnto the vſage of the world; wherein, at the riſing of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sunne, the little birds ſing ſweetlie, as it were ſaluting it, and reioyſing, for the comming of the ſame. So alſo, when the Sunne of Iuſtice was borne in the world, it was fit, that the birds of heauen, (which be the Angels) should shew their ioy by their ſweet ſinging. Some Authors ſay: that the ſong of the Angels was begun by the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and that thereof began the vſage, that at Maſſe, the prieſt that celebrateth beginneth the <hi>Gloria in excelſis,</hi> and the Quier followeth. So the glorious Virgin hauing laid her Sonne in the Manger, and

And to the end, that they deſiring to go and adore him, might find him, he gaue vnto them ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, ſaying: you shall find the infant wrapped in clothes, and laid in a manger.</p>
               <p>O thou bleſſed Angell, theſe ſignes, that thou giueſt, are more like to make one miſſe God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to find him. How; is God an infant: God wrapped in clothes? God in a manger? Haue regard what thou ſaieſt (thou glorious Angell) for all theſe things denote and shew baſenes, contrarie to the ſtate, and maieſtie of God. The Angell replyed: beleeue me, it is as I haue ſaid. God, without being changed,

               <p>Theſe Grecians ſeemed agreeued, that their widowes were not admitted into the publike mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, and affaires; becauſe in thoſe times they that were conuerted, brought all their goods vnto the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">

And to the end, that all things might be done in order, they appointed to euerie one a particuler office: and to the widowes, (that were honeſt and deuout women,) they gaue in chatge to dreſſe the meat, and to attend the table. The Grecians requeſted, that the widowes of thir nation might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto that ſeruice: for euerie one deſired to be employed in ſome office, and to do the beſt ſeruice they could.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles aſſembled together to ſtaye this matter, leaſt it might grow to diſcord. And, hauing called all the diſciples, ſaid vnto them: It is not fit, that we should be buſied in matters of ſuch ſmall importance; therefore let vs find out, and make choiſe of ſome good quiet men, of honeſt fame, who may haue authoritie to prouide perſons, which shall haue care of the prouiſion of dyet, without aggrieuance of any nation, one or other: and out of both nations may be choſen widowes dilligent, and apt to dreſſe meat for the multitude. And when in this matter there may happen any occaſion of diſagreement, they may reſort to thoſe
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:181136:314"/>that be elected, who may quiet all diſſentions, if any ariſe, and that we may attend to preaching, and prayer.</p>
               <p>This reſolution pleaſed them all, and out of the diſciples were choſen ſeuen; and as the head, and chiefe of others, <hi>Stephen</hi> a faithfull man, and full of the holie Ghoſt was choſen. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> out of this gathereth: that S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was a man of great continencie, and gouernement; ſince vnto him was giuen an office, in which he should haue ſo great dealings amongſt women.

He shewed himſelfe to be very vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and couragious, preaching IESVS CHRIT to the Hebrewes, perſwading them to forſake the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> (which now was of no force) and that they should receaue the Ghoſpell and be Baptiſed.</p>
               <p>The matter was brought to that paſſe, that <hi>S. Stephen</hi> was more famous, then any other of the diſciples; becauſe he diſputed face to face with the maiſters of the Sinagogues, in which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated the Grecians of ſundrie Prouinces, as of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and of <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe, who altogether could not make reſiſtance vnto the words of <hi>Stephen.</hi> For he propounded his reaſons with ſuch a ſpirit and wiſedome, and reſolued their arguments ſo cleerlie, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ashamed, and vtterly confounded. Where they should haue taken profit by the ſame, they (contratiewiſe) tooke ſuch indignation againſt him, that they hyred certaine falſe witneſſes, to
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:181136:315"/>accuſe him vnto the high prieſt.</p>
               <p>Hereupon S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was taken, and the witneſſes accuſed him, that they heard him ſpeake blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie againſt God, the Lawe, and the Temple. And they added alſo, that he ſaid: that IESVS of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> should deſtroy that ſacred place, and change the traditions, and ordinances giuen by <hi>Moyſes.</hi> This was an apparant ſlaunder; for this laſt they had not heard S. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſay, but the prieſts ſaid to themſelues that it muſt be ſo, ſince IESVS CHRIST had ſaid ſo; yet they wrong vnderſtood him, when he ſaid vnto them:<note place="margin">Iohn: <hi>2.</hi>

But he entending to make her know, how they had deceiued themſelues in this demaund, for that his kingdome should not be in this world, but in heauen, where if they would haue a peculier place; they muſt (he ſaid) if they would obtaine it, both drinke the ſame cuppe and
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:181136:319"/>ſuffer troubles for Gods ſake, and that therein they muſt alſo looke for his help.</p>
               <p>The night of his laſt ſupper, our Sauiour shewed eſpeciall fauours vnto <hi>S.

Iohn</hi> might do it fitly, as ſitting by our Lord; who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that he was the traytor vnto whom he gaue a morſell of bread dipped in the platter; and then he gaue it to <hi>Iudas.</hi> In the ſame ſupper <hi>S. Iohn</hi> leaned vpon the breaſt of our Lord, and there ſlept; in the which ſleepe, he ſaw many high and ſecret miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which he afterward wrot in his Ghoſpell. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Sauiour went to pray in the garden, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was one of the three diſciples, that he tooke with him, and willed them to watch in prayer. At the time the Iewes apprehended him, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> fled as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles did, but in continent he returned, and ioyntly with <hi>S. Peter</hi> followed him to the houſe of the high prieſt, where he ſaw how <hi>S. Peter</hi> denyed him, and our Sauiour to looke vpon him; and how <hi>S. Peter</hi> repentant for his fault, went forth and wept bitterly for his ſinne.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>S. Iohn</hi> departed from thence, and brought the newes to the mother of God of that which had befallen. Shee was at that time in <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> or elſe, as others will, in the ſame houſe, where CHRIST ſupped with his diſciples, though shee was not preſent therat, but was with drawne in ſome other lodging or roome. <hi>S.

               <p>This ſame diſciple ſtood with the bleſſed Virgin, at the foote of the Croſſe, when our Lord did him that fauour aboue all fauours, neuer ſufficiently praiſed and magnified: ſince, in ſuch a time &amp; ſuch circumſtance, our Redeemer looked with his eyes vpon two ſuch perſons, as were his mother and his diſciple, and ſtudied in what manner he should shew the bond he ought vnto his mother and how she should ſatisfy the loue he bore toward his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he reſolued to giue the diſciple for ſonne vnto his mother and the B. Virgin for mother vnto his diſciple; whereupon he ſaid vnto her: <hi>Woman behold thy ſonne:</hi> It was not forgetfulnes of IESVS CHRIST, that he called the B. Virgin, woman and not mother, for the name of mother, is a word of great tendernes, and it would haue cauſed the B. Virgin to haue shed aboundance of teares, who had before powred teares like raine from her eyes, therefore he called her woman, and not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then he ſaid to the diſciples; <hi>Behold thy mother</hi> there, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> take her to thy mother, for I leaue her vnto thee: She is a Virgin, and thou art a Virgin, it is very meete, that she hold thee for her ſonne, and as a ſonne loue thee, and that thou hold her for thy mother, and as a mother loue and honour her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſtood at the foote of the Croſſe, all the time our Lord remained thereon, learning of him, as of a man reading from a chaire, things wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:181136:320"/>and admirable, and chiefly when by heard him pray for them that crucified him: for then he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a wonderfull leſſon of loue, that ought to be borne not only to ones friends, but alſo to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. CHRIST had ſaid it before vnto them by word of mouth, but on the Croſſe, he confirmed it by deeds; to the end, they might better learne their leſſon.</p>
               <p>At the time our Sauiour called for drinke, and that vineger was giuen him, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> felt incredible griefe, to ſee his Lord an maiſter, (by him ſo much loued) to endure ſuch torments: laſtly IESVS be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, when his ſide was pirced with the ſpeare, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> with the sharpe eyes of the Eagle, ſaw water and bloud to iſſue from the wound, and noted the ſame in his Goſpell. When our Lord was taken from the Croſſe, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> tooke him in his armes, and gaue him to the penſiue &amp; diſcomforted mother, and with her, and with the other that were preſent and that came to take him from the Croſſe, carried him to his ſepulcher. And hauing heard the third day after by the <hi>Maryes,</hi> that our Lord was riſen againe, <hi>S.

               <p>Then late in the euening he ſaw our Lord riſen againe, ioyntly with the other Apoſtles excepting <hi>S. Thomas</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi> He ſawe him alſo another time, being with S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles fishing in the <hi>Tyberia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> when they being in the bark, and our Lord on the shore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was the firſt that knew him. And for that the diſciples ſaid to our Lord, that they had fished all night, and
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:181136:321"/>had taken no thing, our Lord apointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to caſt the nett on the right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There our Lord gaue vnto S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Papacy, which he had promiſed vnto him, and did not giue it vnto S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> for certain reaſons, which the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors alleage: One of the which is this, that if the Pope gaue vnto a ſeruant of his an office, which was worth yearly 1000. ducats, but paid out of it a penſion of 800. ducats, and if to another he gaue an office worth yearly. 500. ducats without pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the ſame, it would appear, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man should be thought to be in the greateſt fauour.</p>
               <p>So alſo was it a great fauour to giue the Papacy and the charge of the Church vnto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but this benefit paid a great penſion out of it, for the many cares and troubles adioyning vnto it. It was alſo a benefit to apoint and aſſigne vnto S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the mother of God, for his mother, which thing was without trouble or charge, and therfore grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the honor done vnto S. <hi>Iohn.</hi>

               <p>The Iſlanders vnderſtanding that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> would depart from the, went all vnto him lamenting and wailing: ſome called him father, others Lord, and all ſaid with one voyce he was theire ioy, and comfort. They beſought him with great affection, ſaying: Oh <hi>Iohn,</hi> thou holy and admirable man, wherefore cameſt thou into this Iſland, if thou art to depart hence ſo ſoone? Why was the knowledge of thee beſtowed on vs, if we were to looſe thy company ſo ſoone? Whither wilt thou go to be beloued, as thou art of vs? Where shall thou be obeyed, as thou art heere? Where shall thy words be ſo eſteemed, ſince we liſten to them, as if they came from God, and do beleeue that God ſpeaketh in thee?</p>
               <p>Then ô father haue pitty on vs thy children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> behold that without thee, we are left in danger and perill to looſe our ſelues: Oh Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi>
                  <pb n="590" facs="tcp:181136:324"/>thou haſt done to none ſuch euill, as thou haſt done good vnto vs: thou haſt ſent hither the elect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of God, whom we haue knowen, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Baptiſme by his meanes. Thou haſt done right well: but for that, to do good was far from thee, of this good ariſeth this preſent euill, that now we muſt looſe him, whom before thou mad'ſt vs to know</p>
               <p>They all came to the holy Euangeliſt, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at his feere, tooke his garments in their hands, kiſſed his hands with great humbleneſſe and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent behauiour, for that they thought to make him ſtay there, more by prayers and entreaties, then by force or violence. They holy Euangeliſt ſawe the griefe of this Iſlanders for his departure, but hee promiſing not to forget them, and to ſend them ſome that should take charge of them, they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſomewhat pleaſed and ſatisfied: And ſo he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked and returned to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with great and incredible ioy.</p>
               <p>As the holy ſaint was to enter the Citty, they carried out to buryall a noble Matrone called <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiana</hi> who had loued S. <hi>Iohn</hi> very dearely. He vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſame by many perſons that followed the corps lamenting and mourning, for the loſſe of ſo vertuous a woman, that was charitable and had done many good workes of piety toward all kind of perſons, and he remembring the ſame pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed for her, and God at his requeſt raiſed againe the dead woman to life, and the holy Apoſtle went to lodge at her houſe.</p>
               <p>Then he began to gouerne that prouince again: and he vnderſtood that two young men in a Citty
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:181136:324"/>had diſtributed much riches vnto the poore, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſerue God in pouerty, (which life <hi>S. Iohn</hi> had commended and praiſed much in his ſermons) but after perceiuing themſelues in great want of neceſſary things, they repented of what they had done. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> talked with them, and badde them bring him, two great branches of trees from a Hill he named, and ſome ſtones, and the young men did ſo. Then the Apoſtle by the power of God turned the ſtones into moſt pretious Iewels, and the branches into Gold, and ſaid to the two young men; Behold now, ſee you may be as rich, as you were before, but conſider well, that the riches of the world doe puffe men vp, and doe not ſatisfy them. Thinke alſo that there is but one paradiſe, and he that will haue it in this life, and enioy and poſeſſe worldly riches: delights, and pleaſures, cannot haue it alſo in the other world.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle did alſo in their ſight raiſt to life, a young man, ſonne to a poore widow, who with many teares beſought him, to haue compaſſion on her, as he had on <hi>Druſiana:</hi> The two young men hauing ſeene this ſtrange miracles, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to continue ſtill in poore life, and beſought the Apoſtle, to pray vnto God for them, and gaue him backe his Iewels and Gold, and he threw it vpon the ground, and they returned to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer nature, and he prayed vnto God for them, and they led a holy life euer after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Iohn</hi> had a great controuerſy and variance with a prieſt of the Goddeſſe <hi>Dyana,</hi> called <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> who ſaid, that the miracles, the Apoſtle did, were not by the power of God, but of the deuill,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:181136:325"/>and if he would haue him to beleeue it was by the worke of God, let him drinke a cuppe of poyſon (that he would temper for him) without any nocument or hurt to his life, or health. The malicious villaine thought by this meanes, to take away the Apoſtles life, and to repaire the loſſe his falſe gods ſuſtained thereby S. <hi>Iohn</hi> accepted of the match, and tooke the impoyſonned cup in his hand, and made thereon the ſigne of the Croſſe, and drunke it of, without receuing any hurt.</p>
               <p>Some Authors ſay, for this cauſe, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a cuppe in his hand, out of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a ſerpent, and he ſeemeth to bleſſe it, which ſignifieth, that he deſtroyed the force of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime. Others ſay, this is not the cauſe, but that he is painted ſo, vpon the words, CHRIST ſaid to him, when his mother requeſted, that hee and his brother might haue the next place vnto him, the one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and the words of CHRIST were theſe: <hi>Can you drinke the cup, which I muſt drinke?</hi> and they anſwered; I: and our Sauiour replyed: <hi>I ſay vnto you in verity, that you shall drinke my cup;</hi> This cuppe (as ſome ſay) is ſignified by the cuppe, which is painted in the hand of <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> and it may be, it is painted there for both the cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn Chriſoſtome</hi> and other Authors recount alſo a ſtory which befell betweene <hi>S. Iohn</hi> and a diſciple of his, being a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull young man. And it was this: <hi>S. Iohn</hi> kept the young man very ſtrait, and would haue brought him to ſtrict and a mortified life: And hauing on a time occaſion to viſite one of his
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:181136:325"/>Churches commended him vnto the care and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of a Bishop, deſiring him to haue good regard of him: In the abſence of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> the young man began by a little &amp; little to fall vnto lewdnes: and at the laſt, to be a Captaine of robbers and murderers by the high way: <hi>S. Iohn</hi> being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and vnderſtanding what was become of the young man, was aggrieued for the ſame, and went vnto the deſert, where the young man kept and haunted: in fine, he met him. He at the ſight of the Apoſtle, began to fly, and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> followed him, ſaying: My ſonne, why doeſt thou flye? behold I am weary, and euen tyred in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to ſeeke thee in this deſert, and vnhabited place: doeſt not thou perceiue, that it is euill done of thee a young man, to flye from me an old man? If thou doeſt it for feare of the account, thou haſt to render vnto God for thy ſinnes, I offer my ſelfe to anſwer for thee, at the day of iudgement. The hart of the young man relented at the words of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and at the teares he ſaw to fall on his white beard; ſo he fell at his feere, bewayling his ſinnes. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> tooke him home, and the young man amended his life and ſerued God, with great feruour after that time.</p>
               <p>Sometime this ſeruant of God shewed indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt them, whom he knew, would not amend their faults. S. <hi>Policarpe</hi> (his diſciple) wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of him, that being one time in a bayn, <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> the heretike came in, and then he made haſt to get out, ſaying with indignation; Let vs get hence quickly, leſt the filthy and corrupt water of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> infect vs, meaning by the water, the falſe
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:181136:326"/>doctrine of the heretike.</p>
               <p>His diſciples importunated him to write that which he preached, that they might haue it in continuall remembrance: The Apoſtle condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to their requeſt, and commaunded a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall faſt and continuall prayers to be kept by all the people: Then went the vpon a mountaine, and tooke only with him his diſciple <hi>Procurus: Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes</hi> ſaith, they heard thunders and thunderclaps with whirlewinds, which put <hi>Procurus</hi> in great feare and dread: but theſe tempeſts being aleyed: <hi>S. Iohn</hi> began to ſay: <hi>In principio erat verbum,</hi> and ſo <hi>Procurns</hi> wrot and continued the Goſpell after his enditing, wherein he laboureth to deſtroy the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the heretiks called <hi>Ebionits,</hi> who held that CHRIST was not God, and the principall entent of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was to shew and proue that CHRIST is true God. And becauſe he flew ſo high, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of an Eagle which is a foule that ſoareth aloft is attributed vnto him.</p>
               <p>The holy Euangeliſt was now farre in yeares, and when he talked with his diſciples, he had all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his mouth theſe words? <hi>My ſonnes, loue one another:</hi> and they ſaid; Maiſter, let vs heare ſome other words, for we haue heard this very often; And he anſwered them: I ſay this thing vnto you, for that this is ſufficient, and he that doth this, doth all.</p>
               <p>Hauing then had reuelation of his death, being 99. yeares ald, he aſſembled all his diſciples, and led them vpon a high mountaine, where a Church ſtood: In that place he cauſed his ſepulcher to be opened, and ſtripped himſelfe of part of his cloths
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:181136:326"/>and put off his shoes, and ſo aliue he went into his ſepulcher, (his diſciples making great lamentation) and then there came from heauen a cleare bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vpon that place, enuironing the body and the holy place; And they that were preſent remained in a traunce, as it ſeemed, for great dread, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to themſelues, they ſaw <hi>S. Iohn</hi> no more, but the graue couered with earth, which ſeemed to boyle vp a pretious liquor that cured many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</p>
               <p>This was the paſſage of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and as <hi>S. Ierome</hi> and venerable <hi>Bede</hi> affirme, his death was without any griefe, and his body neuer felt corruption. Of which words, <hi>S. Thomas, Nicephorus, Calliſtus,</hi> and many other Authors take occaſion to ſay; that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was raiſed againe, and aſcended into heauen, both in body and ſoule, where he hath an eminent place, ſince the titles he had in the world were ſo honourable. He had the title of Virgin, Apoſtle, of Euangeliſt and of martir, at leſt in will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, yea <hi>S Auguſtine,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn Chriſoſtome,</hi> and Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus call him martir, for when he was put into the veſſell of oyle, he should haue dyed, if God had not myraculouſly deliuered him: and his will was always prompt and ready to dye for the loue of IESVS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Beſide the ſaid titles, he had another rare and ſingular name of the <hi>Diſciple beloued of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>of his brother, and ſonnes of the ſame mother,</hi> by the will and appointment of the ſame God.</p>
               <p>This glorious Apoſtle did ſpend 70. yeares in preaching and conuerting of ſoules, all which time he continued buſy in the ſeruice of God,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:181136:327"/>alwayes louing him, and alwayes perſwading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſerue him.</p>
               <p>But all this, which we haue ſaid, is but little to equalize the great glory, that he enioyeth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: although that which he hath, and what place he poſſeſſeth there God and he beſt knoweth.</p>
               <p>Let it ſuffice vs, to recommend vs to him by taking him to our Aduocate, and imitating his life, aſmuch as lyeth in vs: And ſo ayded by him, we may be rewarded by God, and ſee S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, yea God himſelfe, enioying him in his glory for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>The old <hi>Adam</hi> broke the commaundement of God,<note place="margin">Gen: 3.</note> and fled from him, but the new <hi>Adam</hi> to fullfill the commaundement of God, went to hyde himſelf, and laye hid as a ſtranger, for certaine yee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in <hi>Egipt.</hi> This was done for the conſolation of the ſaints, that they should not wonder, if they were forced ſometimes to flye, and if at any time they lye hidden or ſecret, it is no great matter, ſince they be in a ſtrange land. But if they will be in all places happie, and ſecure, let them haue the child IESVS in their companie, though it be in the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had, who were well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, and much made of by that barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the child IESVS ſake, who they had with them.</p>
               <p>A delinquent, or offender, flyeth often vnto the
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:181136:328"/>Church for ſuccour; and ſome times he will take a litle child if he can, and get with him vpon ſome ſteeple, or tower. The people will shoot no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuze or arrow at him, leaſt they might kill the child, but they will rather giue him victuals to eat, leaſt the inocent child, should dye for hunger. So alſo, if a iuſt man ſeing himſelf perſecuted, take IESVS CHRIST which is the child with him in this life he shalbe ſecure and ſaffe; but if he ſtaie to take him in the other life, then he shalbe potent and ſtrong, and then it will litle help, to ſeek to take him vp; as it is to ſmale purpoſe, for them which be in hell, to praie vnto God. CHRIST in this life maie be taken vp as a litle child, and he that shall haue him in his companie, maie be ſecure and aſſured, to haue meanes, and remedies, to be deliuered out of all dangers and perrills, that can come vnto any man,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith in his book of Antiquities, that <hi>Herod</hi> had bene buſied with controuerſies, that he had againſt his owne ſonnes, for the ſucceſſion of his kingdome; and had bene enforced to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to defend his allegations before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus.</hi> And when he had ended that varyance, he began another, with the children of the citizens and inhabitants, of the territorie of <hi>Bethleem. Herod</hi> called then to his remembrance the three kings, which came to ſeek the new borne king of the Iewes. If they had ſaid he had bene in a ſtable, and layd vpon a litle haye, it might be, he would not haue regarded it; but the wiſemen told him, that they ſought the king of the Iewes, who
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:181136:329"/>was latelie borne. <hi>Herod</hi> kept that kingdome by tyrany and force, not comming to it by kinred or bloud, for he was a ſtranger borne; yet he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the religion of the Iewes, &amp; obſerued their lawe.</p>
               <p>He knew that people looked for the Meſſias and king, which should ſet them at libertie, and deliuer them from all opreſſion, which he vnderſtood tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally. when he heard the three wiſe men ſaie, that this king was borne, he grew into a great ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, and ſought by all meanes to know of the law, where this king should be borne; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told by them, that he should be borne in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thleem,</hi> he ſent the kings thither, apointing them to returne vnto <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> and to certifie him, where the new king was to be found, becauſe he alſo, would go to adore him. The curſed wretch ſaid this in deceit, becauſe he would haue murthered him. The mallice of man cannot preuaile againſt the wiſedome of God, for he was ſo blinded, that he had not the reaſon to ſend a meſſenger of his owne with them, to certifie him of their doings.

<pb n="601" facs="tcp:181136:329"/>kingdome, though they haue bene many, and of great difficultie; in which you haue not refuſed to aduenture your liues in my ſeruice. At this time is fallen out a moſt important buſines, vnto which, if I giue not remedie; I shall (remediles) looſe this my kingdome, and you your king; who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies shewed you many fauours, and graced you, and ſtudieth ſtill, to do you many more. Now it ſhall appeere if you be as deſirous to ſerue me; and if you account your ſelues valiant ſouldiers, now is the time to ſhew your valour; for euen in mine owne houſe is a great miſchief readie to oppreſſe me.</p>
               <p>Know then, that my royall eſtate is ſecretlie threatened, yea, the vtter ſubuerſion, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe thereof. There is no open warre proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or made againſt me: neither am I aſſailed, by any publike enemie; but a child, who is not yet two yeeres old, threateneth to depriue me of my crowne, and of the ſcepter of the kingdome of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell.</hi> He is borne in the cittie of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and there he remaineth at this preſent time; and of this child haue the prophets ſaid, that he shalbe king of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and that he shall ſet my crowne on his head, and shall take the ſcepter of the kingdome out of my hand. I feare the prophets, becauſe I haue not ſeene their words fullfilled yet. Do not you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the three kings that came from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> who plainlie reported, that this king was borne, and that they came to worship him, and to giue him obedience.</p>
               <p>If theſe kings ſo farre diſtant ſtood in awe of him, much more cauſe haue I to feare, that am ſo
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:181136:330"/>neere vnto him. I appointed theſe kings, that they should giue me notice when they found him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, I would haue gone to ſee him; and then I would haue beene freed from this danger. But they (I know not for what cauſe) haue mocked me, and be returned into their countries, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes by another waie, and haue giuen me no notice. I feare, I doubt, I faint, and conſume with ſorrow, when I ſtudie on the ſucceſſe of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines. I haue no remedie, and I know not vnto whom to reſort, but vnto you.</p>
               <p>My will therefore is this: I would haue you go vnto <hi>Bethleem,</hi>

Feare not to be accuſed for this fact, for it is by my commaund that you do it. Go into the cittie like Lyons, ſearch it through diligentlie, leaſt any remaine hidden, and perchance it maie be that child, that the kings came to adore.</p>
               <p>The captaines vnderſtanding the kings mind, and intention, gathered all the armie, recyting vnto them the ſame reaſons, that the king had alleadged before. They all accorded and agreed to performe
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:181136:330"/>this miſcheiuous act, and ſo to <hi>Bethleem</hi> they went, and he ſeemed the beſt and worthieſt fellowe, that trauelled thither with moſt ſpeed. So comming to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> they began the maſſacre; the cruell but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſlaughtering the quiet lambes. All the houſes were repleat with the outcries of the afflicted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the waies ſtreamed with riuers of blood, and the ſtreets were filled with bodyes of the hoie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, <hi>Herod</hi> deſired to ſlay IESVS CHRIST in the perſon of euerie one of them; and ſo euerie of them dyed for CHRIST, who being in <hi>Egipt,</hi> had yet compaſſion on them, ſeing they dyed for his, ſake.</p>
               <p>Trulie <hi>Herod</hi> did vnto them herein more good then harme, and more proffit, then damage, ſince they be all ſaued. If theſe children had not bene put to death at that age, and by ſuch occaſion, it might haue come to paſſe, that many of them might haue beene damned. But IESVS CHRIST our bleſſed ſauiour, and of all mankind, would not, that nay of them that were borne in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, and at the time that he was borne, should be condemned. The ſlaughter, and butcherie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewed, the waies were all ſtayned with blood, and the number of dead bodies increaſed, but the rage, and cruell furie of theſe barbarous ruffians, was no whit diminished. The moſt ſecret roomes could not defend the holie infants from the ſlau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter, neither was the Temple, where God was honored, a ſufficient refuge, or ſafftie for their liues In that their Temple, they aſſembled to make their prayers, but they offred no ſacrifice therein, for that was to be done only in the Temple of

               </p>
               <p>They began now to make ſactifices in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> not of brute beaſts, but of innocent children. Euerie thing was ſtayned with blood: graues, and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ches were filled with children, and their dead bodies were lying in euerie place. And if perhaps any mother did hide her ſonne from the ſouldiers, the child manifeſted himſelf, ſeeming with his crying to call thoſe butchers to kill him, becauſe he would not be depriued of ſo happie, and bleſſed death. Some mothers that were more bold, thruſt forward on the executioners, deſirous rather to receaue the blow themſelues, then it should light on their children; but his was to no purpoſe, for themſelues were wounded, and their children ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Some other mothers held them ſo hard in their armes, that they could not get them from them; then would they cut and deuide them in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, ſo that one part of the child remained in the hands of the mother, and the other in hand of the ſouldier. Some women ran to and froe, with their children in their armes, to get out of the place where the ſlaughter was, and ſtumbling on the dead bodies, killed their owne children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>Some other turning vnto theſe bloodie fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, ſaid vnto them: How is it that you become ſo ſenceles, and voyd of pittie? Haue none of you a mother? haue you not wiues and children? Do none of you know how great the loue of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts is toward their children?

The ſouldiers hearing theſe words, were mooued vnto compaſſion and shed teares, but remembring the commaundement of king <hi>Herod,</hi> they became more fierce, and enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged then before, killing a fresh the children in their mothers armes.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who alſo wrote hereof, faith in a ſermon: when our Lord was borne,<note place="margin">ſer: de ſanct: &amp;. <hi>1.</hi> huius feſt:</note> there was heard many plaints, not in heauen, but in earth. The Angells in heauen reioyced, and the mothers which were in earth lamented. God was borne a litle child, and his will was: that vnto him should be offred a ſacrifice of children. He that was to be ſacrificed like a lambe, on the Altar of the Croſſe, would haue the Innocent children ſacrificed vnto him. It was a lamentable ſpectacle, to ſee ſouldiers, with naked ſwords in their hands, to kill ſo many litle infants, and not to know the cauſe, ſeing none of them could committ ſuch an offence, as might merit ſo vntimelie a death. It was euident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that enuy was the only cauſe.</p>
               <p>Theire poore mothers tore their haire, ſtroke their breaſts, and made pittiful outcries, their eyes running like fountaines of water. The more they laboured to hyde their litle infants, the ſooner they were diſcouered; they not hauing the skill to hold their peace, for they had not learned to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are ſuch butcherly ruffians. The mother and the ſouldier ſtrugled together, the one to deliuer her ſonne, the other to take him awaie. The mother
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:181136:332"/>ſaid: why will you pull fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, him that was borne of me? Ah my prettie tender infant, I haue not brought thee ſo carefully vp, that thou shouldeſt be thus rudelie handled. If any fault or offence hath bene committed, I haue done it; let this babe liue, and kill me. Others ſaid: If you look for one alone, why murder you ſo many? Oh come now Sauiour of the world, let theſe ſouldiers ſee thee, without any perill ar danger vnto thee, ſince the power to liue and dye, is at thy pleaſure; ſo shalt thou deliuer vs from this great ſorrow; and our children from death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Gregorie Niſſen</hi> ſaith: It was pittifull, to ſee the mothers of the inocents, how they imbraced their litle infants, and bathed them in teares, awaiting to haue them shortlie bathed in their owne blood. The cruell edict of <hi>Herod</hi> hauing bene brought to <hi>Bethleem</hi> and the cruell ſouldiers being come, they aſſailed the litle infants ſo furioſly, that they wounded the mothers alſo, and mingled the blood of the mother, and the infant together. Some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſawe the ſword to come, and pierce the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of her infant, as she gaue it ſuck, ſo that at one time, the mother gaue milk vnto the child, and the child reſtored aſmuch blood vnto the mother.</p>
               <p>There was one ſorrowfull mother, that had two ſonnes at one birth. She ſaw the ſword dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen againſt them both, and she knew not which to defend firſt from the blowe, she looked on the one, and held it faſt to her breſt, and left the other further from her. Then ſeing the blow come, she pulled it cloſe to her, and thruſt out the other. The poore diſtreſſed mother, had not much time to
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:181136:332"/>deliberate, which of their liues she should longeſt ſaue. for no ſooner was the one wounded to death; but the ſword was thruſt quite through the other. and this was the caſe of many wofull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that had two children in their armes.</p>
               <p>It happened alſo in this maſſacre, that two but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly villaines came vnto a mother, that had two ſonnes; they ſeuered themſelues to kill them, and withall ſeuered the hart of the afflicted mother. The one infant wailed, and the other cryed alſo. The wofull mother knew not which to anſwere firſt, with the like muſick. Laſtly, she could but lament, and ſodeinlie she ſaw them dead at her feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Baſill</hi> Bishop of <hi>Seleucia</hi> (cited before) ſaith: that in all the cittie of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> nothing could be heard, for the confuſed noiſe, which endured as long as the ſlaughter of the innocents contine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed; becauſe the Infants that were killed cryed pittifully, the elder brothers and ſiſters lamented, and ſo did the fathers; but the outcries of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers exceeded all the reſt. The oldmen ſaid: that there was neuer committed ſuch a cruelltie in any place, no not in a long ſuſteined warre; for though all were put to the ſword, yet infants were ſpared.</p>
               <p>Complaints were generallie made, yea, of the ſunne it ſelf, that ſtayed ſo long, to keep back the darknes of the night; whereby the furie of theſe enraged people might ceaſe. When theſe ruffians found no more infants in the cittie to murther, they departed into the villages thereabout, to do as they had done in <hi>Bethleem.</hi> Then the lamentable
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:181136:333"/>outcries of the woefull mothers was renewed, when they went to ſeek out the bodies of their dead infants. Some, that found them cut in pieces, laid their ſeuered members together; vſing pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and compaſſionat complaints.</p>
               <p>Some kneeling downe to their ſlaughtered prettie babe, ſaid vnto him: A wake now my ſonne, thou haſt ſlept inough; shake of this heauie drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, which the cruelltie of <hi>Herod</hi> hath cauſed. Come, come, ariſe my ſweet babe, take thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breaſt, which thou haſt ſo often taſted; Ah wilt thou not ſpeak? doeſt thou ſlumber ſtill? Alas, alas, too long laſteth this heauie ſleep, that thus oppreſſeth thee. would to God it were poſſible for thee to enter againe into my womb, that thy pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie members thus mangled, might be reioyned, and returne vnto life. Theſe and ſuch like words, ſaid the mothers of the Innocents.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Herod</hi> vnderſtood that his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was performed, he made shew of great ioye, and adorned himſelf with a crowne of victorie, as if he triumphed ouer ſome dangerous enemie. Neither did the cruell tyrant care, though his owne child (that was nurſed in a place neere <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thleem</hi>) was murthered among the reſidue.</p>

By which ſpeach he ment, that <hi>Herod</hi> being a Iew, the hogge had bene ſecure, for he would not haue killed it, nor haue eaten thereof, but his ſonne was not ſo ſafe, for he was killed amongſt the other children. <hi>Herod</hi> could not haue
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:181136:333"/>deuiſed a better meanes then this, to diuulge, and ſpread abroad, the birth of CHRIST. For hereby it came to the knowledg of all, that a child was borne, who was a king, and had bene adored of the kings, and of whom he was afeard, that his kingdome should be taken from him. But he ſtayed not ſo long, for before CHRIST was of age, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> was depriued of his kingdome, by looſing of his life, killing himſelf with thoſe hands, with which he had perſecuted our Sauiour CHRIST.</p>

His father was one <hi>Gilbert</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Becket,</hi> a man inferioure to none of his cittizens for kindred and riches; and ſuperioure to moſt, for a ſingular good carriage, and holie conuerſation. This <hi>Gilbert</hi> being in the flower of his youthe, voluntariely receaued the holy croſſ, an enſigne of ſuche as enrolled theyre names to ſerue againſt Infidells, and trauailed into the holie land: where, as he returned from viſiting thoſe ſacred places of Hieruſalem, he, together with others, was taken by his enemies, that lay in ambush; &amp; made priſoner to an Admirall, a Prince of great account amonghſt the Infidells. There he remained in captiuitie, the ſpace of one yeare and

There being firſt well inſtructed in Chriſtian religion and baptized in the Churche of S.

<pb n="614" facs="tcp:181136:336"/>to ſome ouer sharpe courſe and rough pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: deſirous alſo, that the bond of loue and amitie might encreaſe betweene the Prince and his Prelats, and the kings gracious fauoure shine vpon his cleargie, a thing moſt neceſſarie, for the good and well fare of all the kingdome: and well aſſured of his Archeadeacons ſufficiencie to doe all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruice to the kinge, &amp; good offices to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of people: brought him to the courte, and wrought him into the fauoure of his Maieſtie; from whome he receaued the office of high Chanceloure of England. It might ſeeme in outward shew and apparance, that Thomas had now forgotten quite, that euer he was an Archedeacon. His retinue was greate; his followers men of good account; his houſekeeping ſuch as might compare with, yf not ſurpaſſe, the greateſt Earles of the kingdome; his ſtuffe verie coſtlie and full of brauerie, ſo farre forth as bridles of beaten ſyluer; his principall care to retaine his Princes fauoure, and winne all mens good will; which care did alſo compell him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to shew himſelfe plyant to this Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi> in his fare, his diſcourſe, in hauking in huntinge and ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, aſwell as in his ſerious affaires: A table, that daylie and Honorably intertained Barons &amp; Earles: a houſe, that wellcomed all needie &amp; afflicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: a hand, that bountifully beſtowed large gyfts in howſehold ſtuffe, apparail, prouiſion, plate and coyne. Finally fortune did ſeeme to haue made him her darling; and all things ſo flowed according to his wish &amp; his deſire, that one would haue Iudged him, to haue laide cleane aſide the verie thought of a cleargie man. But this was only the outſide of
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:181136:336"/>Thomas: for inwardly, he was humble and abject in his owne eyes: much addicted to praier and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: a greate tamer &amp; curber of his owne body; in ſo muche, that manie times he would chaſtize himſelfe with a cruell diſcipline, lashing himſelfe vpon the bare backe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his zeale was greate for the good of the churche, and reliefe and ſuccoure of the commons; vndergoing for this cauſe manie encounters and afflictions; manie calumniations, ſlaunders, and ſnares, armed to entrap him, by ſuch as in court know not how to riſe but by others ruines. Nay ſometimes, as farre as Majeſtie and duetie would permit it, he gently, and with greate reſpect &amp; reuerence, withſtoode euen his Prince; who liked therein his conſtancie, and tooke it in good part, and not as proceeding of anie diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. for why? he did finde him moſt faithfull in all his proceedings: aduiſed &amp; diſcreete in counſaile: prouident &amp; vn appalled in doubtfull buſineſſe: and in aduerſitie valiant and magnanimous: in puritie of mind, &amp; chaſtitie of bodie euermore vnſpotted and vndefiled: manie greate trialls hauing bin made to proue his honeſtie. And, for moſt of that which we haue rehearſed, let this one thinge ſerue as a ſufficient witneſſe. There was in <hi>Stafforde</hi> a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autifull yonge woeman, whom the Prince greately fauoured. She, as often as the Chanceloure came that way, did ſend him manie tokens and fauoures. Her guardian, miſdoubting that all this kindneſſe proceeded from ſome lewd intention; and, ſeing the yonge, fresh, beautifull yeares of Thomas, and the neereneſſe of theyr lodginges did encreaſe his ſuſpicion, he needes would be acertained the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof.
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:181136:337"/>In the dead of the night, by a ſecret way, and with a cloſe lanterne, in he goeth to his chamber; and findinge his bed with our anie print of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or once being touched, was ſtrongly confirmed in his ſuſpicion: but lyfting vp his lanterne, and looking ſome what further, he found, that after longe kneeling vpon his bare knees in prayer, he was fallen faſt a ſleepe vpon the grounde, in a verie incomodious manner. whereupon altering his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, he verily deemed him a ſaincte, whom before he ſuſpected to be dishoneſt.</p>
               <p>Not only in this of Chancelour, but alſo in manie other offices Thomas did the kinge good ſeruice: for, being made tutour to the yonge Prince Henry, his care was greate to bringe him vp with the ſonnes of manie Lords of the court, in learning &amp; ciuilitie, &amp; all manner of courtly and Princely knowledge and behauiour. Moreouer he ſerued the kings Majeſtie in his warres of Fraunce with a choyce band of ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundred ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioures of his owne familie, beſides manie others, with whome alone after the kings departure, he obtained a worthie victorie. yea another time, he himſelfe in perſon vnhorſed a frencheman called <hi>Enguerranus de Creya,</hi> a moſt hardie ſouldiour, and moſt renouned in all deeds of armes and chiualrie. And with his good example he ſo encouraged all his followers, that in all the kinges armie the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours souldiours were eſteemed the verie flower and the valianteſt.

Eſpecially the kings
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:181136:337"/>Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi> of England ſometimes after hunting, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after riding, would, vpon a ſoddaine &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie biddinge, come the Chancelours houſe when they were at dinner, and ſomewhiles dine with him, other whiles ſitte by him to ſee the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and heare the diſcourſe which was at his table; whereof manie things were ſpoken with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>Theſe words of the Chanceloure, ſo litle taſting of Ambition, ſo plainely diſcloſing a conſtant reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, did more enkindle the kinges deſire. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore ioyning others in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie to effect his purpoſe, he called to the chiefeſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

To the ſame effect he like wiſe ſpake to <hi>Henricus Piſanus</hi> Cardinall, and legate of the Pope; who at laſt brought Thomas to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that dignitie. He was choſen at London at weſtminſter by the whole conſent of all the Bish<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. of the Realme, only London exepted, and by the voyce of Canterburie monkes; and after was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto prince Henry. who, by the authoritie of his Father, committed vnto him for this effect, freed the Chanceloure from all former debts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and obligations of court or exchequer, &amp; in his full libertie reſtored him vnto his cleargie, who receaued him with great ioy and ſpirituall canticles. After his election at London he went to Canterburie; where in white ſonday-weeke he was made prieſt vpon the ſatterday (hitherto he was but Deacon) and conſecrated Bishop vpon Trinitie ſundaye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prince Henry heire apparant of

Pope of Rome did ſend him the Palle: which he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with vnaccuſtomed deuocion, going bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote, and lying proſtrate on the ground.</p>
               <p>Hauing now receaued that ſacred vnction, he was changed into an other man.

Hauing done his office ſtreight after the cocke-crowing, he ſerued thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene poore men at the table, waiting on them in perſon, washinge allſo theyre feete, not only with water, but with his owne teares, crauing moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly theyr prayers, &amp; giuing eache of them foure pence in monie: in the morning, verie earlie, twel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue more were ſerued by the Arche B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. almoner; &amp; about nine of the clocke a hundred poore men called Prebens, on whome two monkes of the conuent attended.

When he was to celebrate the moſt dreadfull oblation, then he did ſeeme to poure out his hart with teares and
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:181136:339"/>ſighes and ſobbes, that cames as often as his words. He was ſomewhat ſpeedie in diſcharginge this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, fearinge diſtractions; yett all wayes attent, &amp; recollected, without vaine addinge of more then the churche appointed; performing the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with ſuche deuotion and teares, as yf he did viſibly behold the wounds of our ſauiour IESVS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Not only his owne, but alſo the hands of all his houſehold were ſo free from receauing bribes, that an Abbot comminge to his courte with important buſines, and deſiring to winne his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers good will with gold, and not findinge anie that would receaue it, he himſelfe notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding receauing great ſatisfaction in his ſuite, cryed oute at his departure: I haue founde a court more golden, then euer I could haue belieued or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: for not onlie it walketh not after gold, but alſo ſcorneth, deſpiſeth, &amp; flyeth from gold. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable to theſe were all his other vertues: ſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right a Iudge, that no might nor meanes could with-drawe him right: ſo good a father to the poore, that none departed from him without reliefe: ſoe bountifull in giuinge almes, that he twice doubled the vſuall allowance giuen to the poore by all his Predeceſſoures: ſo zealous a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that no vice, eſpecially no ſchiſme or errour could take roote with in his Iuriſdiction: ſo addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to learninge that his conuerſation at table &amp; vpon the way, was allway of learning: ſo proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in giuing orders, that he neuer impoſſed his hands vpon anie, without mature and diligent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xamine, whither he had ſufficiencie enough in

               <p>Finallie his watching in meditation, his teares in praying, his puritie of life, his modeſtie in ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, his vprighteouſnes in his workes, his trueth in his word, his compaſſion of the poore, &amp; care of the commons goode and welfare did ſpread his fame ſo wyde, that it made the Kinges Maieſtie hartilie to reioyce for the good election he made of ſo holy a prelate.

<pb n="622" facs="tcp:181136:340"/>the Arche Bishop.</p>
               <p>Hitherto he might ſeeme to haue had a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courſe and nauegacion: but God would haue him alſo tryed in aduerſitie, and therefore ſuffered a ſtorme of perſecution to be raiſed againſt him. Firſt certaine men of greate account, oute of whoſe hands he had wreſted churche-liuings, which they had wrongfully vſurped, began to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate him with his Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi>, alleaging that his royall fauoure emboldned the Arche B. to ſuch attempts and wrongs, which he had, and did offer vnto manie: yet they could not impaire the good opinion, which the kinge entertained of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che B. Then followed his renouncing the office of Chanceloure, which ſomewhat exaſperated the Kinge: next ſome reſiſtance in a matter belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Exchequer. But laſtly that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled his Ma<hi rend="sup">tys</hi> indignation was in this manner. The friends of a certaine, man that was ſlaine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed a prieſt for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting the murder: he, being apprehended, and brought before his Biſshop, ſo denied the facte, that his aduerſaries could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently conuince him; by reaſon theyre informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was weake; neyther he Canonically cleare himſelfe. He therefore remaining thus infamous, and branded with ſuſpicion, his cauſe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Arche B, who depriued him of all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall benefice, and shut him vp in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, commaunding that he should be perpetually recluded, and made doe hard penance all dayes of his lyfe. About the ſame time one <hi>Philip</hi> de <hi>Lidrois</hi> a Canon had contumeliouſly abuſed one of the Kings Iuſtices of peace: the complaint being
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:181136:340"/>brought to the Archebishop, he commaunded the Canon should be publiquely whipped, &amp; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yeares depriued of all Eccleſiaſticall benefice and office. Theſe punishments, eſteemed rigorous enough, could not quyet the rage of ſome of the laitie: for laying ſome few mens faults vpon all the cleargie; and pleading, that prieſts and clearks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on their priuiledges, &amp; that they were not put to death, committed manie outrages, offences and vilainies, they made a great vproare and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion in all the countrie.</p>
               <p>The Kings Majeſtie as zealous of the peace and quyet of the commonwealth, as the Archebishop of the Churches liberties; and being informed by ſome of the cleargies enemies, how their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold offences daylie encreaſed, preſuming vpon their priuiledges; he made an aſſembly of all the Bishops of the Realme, and cleargie of London, demaunding, that all ſuch Prieſtes as committed anie offence, should enioy no priuiledge of the Church; but, deliuered ouer to the ſecular Iuſtice, be punished with corporall paiue; the only meanes as he ſaid, to ſtop the courſe of their wickedneſſe, who building to much vpon their order, ſtained &amp; shamefully debaſed the renoumne and glorie of their order. For the higher one is ſeated in dignity, the fouler is his crime and more exhorbitant; the more ſcandalous his example, and of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to draw meaner people into ſinne: and therefore ſuch deliquentes ought to feele the ſmart of more heauie punishments.</p>
               <p>To this demaund the holie Prelate mildly and conſtantly replied: That ſacred Canons, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:181136:341"/>Councels, and holie Popes, and glorious Kings &amp; Emperours had ſo ordained, that cleargie men should be iudged and chaſtized by none, but only their owne ſuperiours and Prelates.</p>
               <p>That when crimes were ſuch as deſerued death, the Church did not winke at her miniſters faults; nor foſter enormous offences with priuiledges; but firſt degrading them from their order, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done and forſake them as none of hers; and then turne them ouer to the ſecular power and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to giue their wickedneſſe it's due reuenge and recompence. That ſeeing this had beene the auncient practize of the primitiue Church in her glorious dayes, and now wee had no new Chriſt, nor new Church; he beſought the royall clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his Maieſtie not to bring in this new manner of proceeding, ſo contrarie to the ſtatutes of all Antiquitie: neither ſo to be lead with a zeale of Iuſtice, as to raze the verie foundations of Iuſtice: which could not ſtand firme, without conſeruing the bounds and limits preſcribed vnto each power and authoritie.</p>
               <p>But the King eſteeming this ſo round &amp; reſolute an anſwer to be a diſloyaltie in his Bishops, and open-withſtanding his ſoueraigne authoritie; did preſſe them further to make him a promiſe of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his ancient prerogatiues and royall cuſtomes.</p>
               <p>The Archbishop with the aſſent of his brethren anſwered, they would; ſo farre forth as they were not contrarie to the priuiledges and prerogatiues of the Church, ſoe firmely eſtablished.</p>
               <p>Now amonghſt thoſe royall prerogatiues theſe ſixe were included amonghſt many others. 1. That
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:181136:341"/>vpon no cauſe whatſoeuer, any appeale should be made to the Sea Apoſtolique, without hauing obtained licence of his Maieſtie. 2. That it should neuer be lawfull for any Bishop or Archbishoppe to depart out of the kingdome, or come at the commaund of the Pope, without licence of the King. 3. That it should not be lawfull for any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to excommunicate any perſon, that holdeth <hi>in Capite</hi> of the King, without licence of the King, nor graunt any interdict againſt his lands, nor the lands of any his officers. 4.

That the King and his ſecular Iuſtices, and other officers should bee Iudges in matters of Tithes, and other like cauſes Eccleſiaſtical. Theſe were contained amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other articles, drawn by his Maieſties officers, as auncient prerogatiues of the Crowne: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were ſo contrarie and preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the practize of the Primitiue Church, and priuiledges of great Kings &amp; Monarches; yet his Maieſtie, thereunto moued by his officers, and eſteeming it a great diſparagement of his Princely autoritie to be ſubiect to the Church; and want of Iuſtice, not to chaſtize the offences of cleargie-men moſt earneſtly inſiſted to haue all the Bishops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe without any reſtriction or limitation, to keep the aforeſaid prerogatiues, contained as he ſaid in their temporall allegiance.</p>
               <p>And not hauing obtained his deſire, hee was greatly incenſed againſt the Bishops, and riſing
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:181136:342"/>in a great wroth and indignation went forth of the place, wherein was the aſſembly, and next day very earely, without giuing audience to any of the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, out of London. All the courte was in a tumult and vproare; and now of the Bishops ſome began to shrinke, and ſeeke by all meanes, though with shipwracke of their conſcience, to recouer the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of their Prince, and remaine aſſured of their temporall goods, though with euident hazard of looſing thoſe which are euerlaſting. Amonghſt the Prelates, ſome, that should haue aduaunced the vnitie of the Church, gaue the King counſaile to ſet the Prelates at variance amonghſt themſelues. Others laboured to make the Archbishop more plyant to his Maieſties will; with promiſes, with menaces, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore oppreſſed with the weight of manie Noblemen and Prelates perſuaſions, and with the teares of many, that bitterly wept the vtter ruine and diſtruction of the cleargie, he yeelded to the will and pleaſure of his Maieſtie, and in a Generall
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:181136:342"/>Parlament holden at Claringdon promiſed in the word of Trueth, and without any reſtriction or limitation, to keepe the aforenamed Prerogatiues, and ſo did likewiſe all the other Bishops.</p>
               <p>The King was not yet contented heerewith: but, hauing drawne a writing of thoſe preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, would, for the greater euidence and ſtrength thereof, haue it ſigned with all the Prelates ſeales. The Archbishop, crauing ſome little reſpitte to conſider of ſo weighty a matter, tooke one coppie of the writing with himſelfe, and gaue one to the Archbishop of Yorke, leauing the third in his Maieſties hand: and ſo, being licenſed by the King, departed from the Courte, and went towards <hi>Winton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now being retired, and alone by himſelfe; and reflecting vpon all his former actions: &amp; duely poiſing the ſequele of all this buſineſſe: how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicious it would be to all the Church of God; what a breache and confuſion of Eccleſiaſticall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; how great a ſlauerie to men, that were the particular lot of IESVS CHRIST; and how bad a precedent to all the world, and ſcandall to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes and Prelates; ſorrow, griefe, teares ſighes, and ſobbes proceeding from a repentant heart, did make him conſume and melt away. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he content to doe rigorous penance in faſting and ſack-cloth, but he alſo ſuſpended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the Altar, and from the communion of the bodie and bloud of our Sauiour CHRIST; vntill he was reſtored thereunto by the abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſpirituall conſolation of the Bishoppe of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="628" facs="tcp:181136:343"/>
               <p>The King vnderſtood of the Archbishops change and alteration: and all his proceedings were ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated and miſconſtered by his calumniators &amp; aduerſaries. His auſteritie of life was ſuperſtition: his zeale of Iuſtice nothing but crueltie: the care of his Churches reuenues was attributed vnto couetuouſneſſe; his contempt of wordly fauours was deſire of vaine glorie: following the will of God a proud conceite of himſelfe: inſiſting in his Aunceſtours ſteppes in defending right, and a little more care thereof, then ſome of his later ſlacke temporizing Predeceſſoures, rashneſſe and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much wilfulneſſe: finally ſome made no ſcruple to ſay, that, if the Archbishops power went on in that manner, the Kings Maieſties royall dignitie would quite decay: and Princes should heere after reigne, ſuch, and ſo long, and with only that power and autoritie, as the Archbishoppe with his cleargie would.</p>
               <p>Heereupon the Archbishop was cited to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before his Maieſtie at <hi>North-Hampton.</hi> Firſt he was iudged both by Nobleman and Prelates to haue all his moueables confiſcated, for not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perſonally vpon a citation of the King: and yet his anſwer to their obiection was verie ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Now in the verie firſt entrance and beginning heere were two ſtrange things (as the Archbishop pleaded) and neuer heard of before in the world; An Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate of <hi>England,</hi> ſpirituall father both of Prince an People, iudged by the Peeres that were his children: and Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans pronouncing ſentence of condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Metropolitan, ouer whom they had no
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:181136:343"/>iuriſdiction. He was further call'd in queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 500<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. receaued of the King, during the time of his Chanceloureship. He acknowledged the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, but pleaded 'twas a guift; and yet was the money adiudged to the King; and he ſtraight wayes enforced to giue ſecuritie for the payment thereof: or in plaine tearmes commaunded to his face to remaine there as priſoner. When ſome perceauing the Archbishop quite forſaken of his bretheren, and in daunger of shipwrack, offered themſelues of their owne accord to enter band, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the monie, and ſo this daunger was eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. Many other controuerſies of old forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheq. matters were maliciouſly enforced againſt him by his Aduerſaries, only of purpoſe, as men talked then, to ouerwhelm the Bishop. But <hi>Henrie</hi> Bishop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> a man renowned for nobilitie of birth and a ſanctlike life, found a way to free him from all further troubles in this kinde; by auouching: That when, being Archdeacon and Chanceloure, he was choſen for to be Archbishop, he was by the Kings authoritie freed and acquitted of all debts and obligations of Courte and Exchequer, and ſo deliuered ouer to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, being ſo euidently, true none could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Now remained the laſt and the fierceſt aſſault concerning thoſe royall Prerogatiues.</p>
               <p>The Archbishop hoping thereby to moue his Maieſtie the ſooner to compaſſion and clemencie towards the Church, reſolued the laſt day to goe to Court in his ſacred roabes, and bare footed with his croſſe in his hand, and kneeling on his knees entreate his Maieſtie for peace. Heerein alſo his
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:181136:344"/>aduerſaries depraued his good intention, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the King, that he was come all armed to courte. His Maieſtie hearing the bruite of armes, and not informed, nor reflecting of what ſort and condition they were, withdrew himſelfe into an inner roome: &amp; there, calling vnto him the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Bishops, made a grieuous complaint and narration, how the Archbishop was come, not as into the Courte and Pallace of a King, but the houſe of a Traitour; in ſo odious and deſpitefull a manner, as neuer was heard of before in the courte of any Chriſtian King.</p>
               <p>There wanted not others that ſeconded &amp; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified his Maieſties ſpeeche: alleadging that his pride had now drawne him ſo farre, as to make him fall into open Treaſon and Periurie, himſelfe; and, with his manner of proceeding, caſt vpon the King and all his kingdome an aſperſion, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous note of Treaſon. All the chamber reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Periurie, Treaſon: and the officers of the Courte came forth, and with enraged lookes poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Bishoppe, that was left all alone with his croſſe in his handes; the banner vnder which he was to fight, the portraiture of him, that he was to follow, only ſome few of his Chaptaine about him; and euen thoſe were not permitted by the officers to ſpeake vnto him. Proclamations were made, that none should declare himſelfe of the Archbishops ſide, vnder paine of being accounted an enemie to the ſtate. The Bishops they appealed againſt their Primate, as one that was periured; not obſeruing the allegiance he had ſworne to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. The Earles and Barons were now come forth
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:181136:344"/>to giue iudgement againſt him. To whome all, but eſpecially to the Earle of <hi>Leiſter,</hi> that had ſpoken in the behalfe of the reſt, the Archbishop made this anſwer; Iudgement againſt me, my Lord and my Sonne? neither law nor reaſon doth permit, that children should iudge and condemne their Father. My ordinarie Iudge is the Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> to him I appeale from your Iudgement. And likewiſe I ſummon theſe my brethren, to appeare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all matters and controuerſies in his Tribunall. Hauing ſaid theſe words, and fearing with his ſtay to giue them occaſion of heynous ſacriledge, hee forthwith departed from the Courte, many of his aduerſaries, and ſome others of the Courtiers follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing after, and reuiling and calling him a haughtie, proud, and periured Traitoure.</p>
               <p>All his traine and followers were fledde: and only ſome cleargie men attended on him, with a great number of ſicke folkes and poore men, that hartily reioyced and praiſed God; who had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his ſeruaunt from the hands of his enemies. How glorious a proceſſion, quoth the Bishoppe, doth accompanie oure returne from the face of tribulation! Sithence they haue shared in oure affliction, let them all come in, that wee may all feaſt together in our Lord. After prayer ſome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made of the bitterneſſe and dreadfulneſſe of that day: Vnſpeakeably more bitter, quoth the Bishop, and more dreadfull will the latter day be. And I charge you all, that each man demeane himſelfe modeſtly, quietly, patiently: and that none be ſo bold as to vtter any rough or diſtaſtfull words. In ſuch traunces as theſe, a patient &amp; milde
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:181136:345"/>ſuffering is moſt gratefull to God; and moſt auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable to worke good in all men, whether inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, or ſuperiours. In the dead of the night two Noblemen of great renowne in the kingdome, and his faithfull friends, came vnto him, and with rue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lookes, and teares in their eyes, and knocking their breaſt proteſted by the dreadfull iudgement of God almightie, how they certainly knew, that ſome debauched and wicked people had conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, &amp; with mutuall oathes bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to kill him. Wherefore, greatly fearing, leaſt the cauſe of the Church, which was not fully made knowen to the world, should be not only enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged, but vtterly ouerthrowen with his death; he reſolued to depart out of the kingdome. He deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed himſelfe, &amp; trauailed by night, went ſtrange and vncouth wayes, lay ſecret and hidden euen in his owne Lordships, hearing ſeruice from out of a little hoale; &amp; finally apparailed in a white monkes weede, and going barefooted, and calling himſelfe brother <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> got ſafely in a little boate out of the Realme; and with great labour, penurie, afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, difficulties, and daunger, ſometimes trauailing twelue leagues in a winters day barefooted, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at laſt at <hi>Sens,</hi> in Fraunce where <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 3 Pope, driuen out of <hi>Italie</hi> by a ſchiſme, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The King had ſent, before his comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an honorable Embaſſage by the Archbishop Of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and 4. other Bishops; the Earle of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> and other Noblemen, to certifie the Pope, and complaine againſt the Archbishop, and obtaine that he might be ſent backe into <hi>England,</hi> with a <hi>

<pb n="633" facs="tcp:181136:345"/>there. And although they obtained not their ſuite, by reaſon of the Archbishops abſence, who according to law, should firſt be heard in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, before any courſe were taken againſt him; yet ſo had they alienated the affections of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals from him, that verily eſteeming him a rash, preſumptuous, ſtiffe-necked man, and one that for matters of no importance, had made an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare in the kingdome, and broaken that vnitie and bond of peace, which before was betweene the king and the cleargie, none of them would shew him any countenance. The day next enſuing, wherein the Archbishop in the preſence of Pope and Cardinals was to deliuer the ſtate of all the controuerſie; hauing firſt related the glorie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he liued before, the exceeding great fauours which his Maieſtie had shewed him, the reſpect which all the kingdome did beare vnto him, how all thinges flowed euen according to his will, vntill the time of his Maieſties indignation: hauing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore declared, how eaſily he could yet be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and winne the Prince his fauour againe, and be admitted into as great grace as euer before, and that without any bodies mediation. in caſe he would ſwarue from his conſtant reſolution, and ſubſcribe to that, which the king demaunded: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing alſo shewed, how, although he abounded not in witte, yet he was not ſo deſtitute of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, as to leeſe matters of ſuch weight for only trifles; Laſtly hauing told them how that for the ſame cauſe, for which he had loſt all other temporall goods, he would moſt willingly ſacrifice the verie laſt drop of his bloud; But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:181136:346"/>quoth he, rashly and vnaduiſedly, led by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie and ambition, or diſcreetly and vertuouſly, moued thereunto by a well grounded reſolution, let theſe ſerue for witneſſe and euidence. And with that he drew forth the originall coppie of thoſe Articles, which his Maieſtie would haue eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablished, as auncient and royall Prerogatiues. Which Articles being read, not only the Pope, but alſo thoſe Cardinals, who before were offended with the Archbishop, did now with teares thanke almightie God, for giuing him grace and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to withſtand ſuch pernicious conſtitutions, ſo oftentimes reprooued, &amp; condemned by Generall Councels and ſacred Canons. And all of them with one aſſent concluded, that, to helpe the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, was, in his perſon, to ſuccoure the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church of God.</p>
               <p>There <hi>Thomas</hi> would haue reſigned his dignitie; and drawing to that purpoſe his ring from his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and offering it vp, moſt humbly beſought his holineſſe, to prouide a more fit and worthie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoure to rule his flocke. It ſeemed not conuenient to the Pope, to condeſcend vnto his requeſts: nay rather he confirmed him in his dignitie, to the end, other Prelats should not in like caſes ſlacken in their duetie, and feare in future times to withſtand Princes willes, in matters that were damageable to the Catholique Church, ſeing one that had ſo valiantly fought in her defence, depriued of the dignitie of Archbishop. And promiſing him to doe his beſt endeuoure to reconcile him vnto his king, he commended him to an Abbot of a monaſterie called <hi>Pontiniacum,</hi> of the order called <hi>Ciſtercienſis,</hi>
                  <pb n="635" facs="tcp:181136:346"/>which flourished with renoune of ſanctitie. There <hi>S. Thomas</hi> liued with an admirable peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde, amidſt all his troubles, giuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholely to reading, to prayer and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: chaſtizing his bodie with extraordinarie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and penance. His dyet was certaine vnſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie rootes, and herbes &amp; other groſſe meates, which he himſelfe eate though priuately, beſtowing all other daintyer dishes vpon the ſicke &amp; the needy. Next to his skinne he euermore did weare a long rough haireshirt, that couered all his bodie from the necke to the knees. His diſciplines were vſuall and verie cruell; and ſometimes for a greater mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification he would ſtandnaked in a cold ycie riuer vntill ſuch time, as he was almoſt frozen. And accordingly to this his life did ſeeme a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall death. All which auſterities, though he did couragiouſly vndergoe them, with a cheerefull countenance, at length did caſt him into ſuch a ſicknes, that he was euen at the point of death.</p>
               <p>But none of theſe things did afflict him at all, in compariſon of the griefe, which he receaued by the banishment of his friends. For the king, firſt confiſcating all the goods of the Archbishop, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in like manner againſt all his kindred, and ſuch as by familiaritie, or any other title had depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of him; and afterwards, neither ſparing age, nor ſexe, nor qualitie nor condition, banished them from out of all his dominions, compelling ſuch, as might for age, to ſweare they would goe vnto the Archbishoppe, whereſoeuer he was, and complaine of him, as of the ſole cauſe of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, loſſes, ruine and deſtruction. The calamitie
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:181136:347"/>of ſo manie innocent people, banished for his ſake, yet without his fault, did greatly grieue the good Archbishop: he offered vp theſe troubles, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their cauſe to God and his friends; who ſo bountifully prouided for the banished; that, in a short time, none did feele any want; and many found that plentie in forraine countries, which they had loſt for Gods ſake in their owne.</p>
               <p>The king, moued thereunto by his officers, did not deſiſt to further moleſt the Archbishop. For writing to the Generall chapter of the <hi>Ciſtercienſes</hi> he threatned all their order with grieuous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if they kept his enemie any longer in their monaſterie. <hi>S. Thomas</hi> vnderſtanding this, leſt thoſe good religious men should ſuffer any damage for his ſake, departed from thence of his owne accord, and with licence of <hi>Lewes</hi> king of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him a Princely allowance out of his owne Exchequer, went to make his aboade in the cittie of <hi>Sens:</hi> where hee was moſt ioyfully and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably welcomed by <hi>Hughe</hi> Archbishop of that citty and all his cleargy.</p>
               <p>The Kings Maieſtie of <hi>England</hi> endeuoured alſo to caſt him out of <hi>Fraunce;</hi> and to that purpoſe did ſend an Embaſſage, and write his letters, complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſometimes Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> who like a Traitour had fled out of his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, deſiring King <hi>Lewes</hi> not to relieue him, nor permit him to abide any longer in his countrey. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſometimes Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> quoth the King! And who, I pray you, hath depoſed him? Certes I account my ſelfe as abſolute a King, with as full authority, as the King of <hi>England;</hi> yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:181136:347"/>may I, nor can I depoſe the meaneſt prieſt of all my kingdome.

Many ſtrange meanes were vſed alſo to withdraw the Popes affection from <hi>S. Thomas;</hi> and winne his good will to fauoure the King againſt the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop; and with cunning diſſimulation cloſe vp the matter; ſo that the King should admitte the Archbishop into his fauour and reſtore him peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his Sea, but with this addition <hi>sauing the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his kingdome,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> should promiſe to obſerue the royall Prerogatiues without adding this clauſe <hi>Sauing the liberty of the Church.</hi> And ſurely ſome of the Cardinals had condeſcended to the Kings requeſt, but that <hi>S.

At length the King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> with entreaty, and the Pope with the terroure of the Churches
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:181136:348"/>cenſures, made a full attonement and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene his Maieſtie of <hi>England</hi> and the Archbishop: the King not only recalling him and all his friends from his banishment, but alſo wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into <hi>England,</hi> that peacebly, well, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably he &amp; his might be reſtored to all, which they enioyed three moneths before his departure out of <hi>England.</hi> He led him alſo aſide, and talked with him ſo long, and ſo familiarly, as if no diſagreement had euer bin betweene them: he gaue him leaue to proceede againſt ſuch of his ſuffragans, as had offended during his abſence: and at his departure willed him to forget all former hatred, and reſtore vnto each other their auncient loue and affection: and ſo the Archbishop humbling himſelfe at his Maieſties feete, tooke his leaue and departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>England,</hi> after ſeauen yeares of banishment. And although he vnderſtood by the Earle of <hi>Bullen</hi> and manie others comming out of <hi>England,</hi> that no other preparation was made there to receaue him but of priſons and bonds, and treacherous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and thirſting after his bloud and his life; yet would he not ſtay his iourney, but anſwered. All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I should be torne in pieces, I wil not break of my intended iourney: no feare, no force, no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall ſtay me any longer: let it ſuffice that the flocke of CHRIST hath, for ſeauen yeares ſpace, bewailed the abſence of her shepheard. At his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into his Church he was receaued with great ioy and deuotion, by the cleargie and all well affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people; though ſome others, guiltie of their owne wickedneſſe, repined thereat, and endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue hindered his landing with armed men.
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:181136:348"/>Whereſoeuer the Archbishop went, there was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great ioy and triumph; eache Parish, with their croſſes and Parish prieſts, wellcoming him with a ſolemne proceſſion, and ioyntly ſinging and weeping for ioy; and praiſing God, that had ſent them home their Father againe. Whithin ſome few dayes after, at his comming to London, there was the like publike ioy and triumphing. For all the cleargie and poore-ſchollers of the cittie, to the number of three thouſand men, went forth to meete him without the cittie.

               <p>But this reioycing and gladneſſe laſted not long: for ſome Bishops and other men of great account, that were excommunicated by the Pope, reſorted vnto the Archbishop, and earneſtly required to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue their abſolution at his hands.</p>
               <p>He anſwered, that, notwithſtanding their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication &amp; ſuſpenſion was from the Pope, yet he would preſume ſo farre, as to abſolue them, in caſe they would make him a Canonicall caution or aſſurance, of ſtanding to the Iudgement of the Church in thoſe things, for which they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.

<pb n="640" facs="tcp:181136:349"/>royall perſon: that, to be a King indeede, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but the name, and ſetting the Crowne vpon his head, and ſaying that he would be King. That ſuch, as were moſt loyall to his Maieſtie, were moſt oppreſſed with frequent exactions and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications by the Archbishop: and manie other ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeuances and calumnations to the ſame purpoſe, which ſo much enraged and enflamed the Kinges indignation, that, with anxietie of minde, he burſt forth into theſe impatient words. <hi>And is it posſible, that I cannot peaceably enioy neither Kingdome, dignitie, nor life; and all this for one only Prieſt? Curſed be all ſuch as eate my bread, ſince none will reuenge me of this fellow.</hi> Vpon theſe words ſome principall gentlemen of the Kings chamber, conſpired together, and with oathes and proteſtations combined themſelues, to kill the Archbishop: imagining it would be moſt gratefull ſeruice to the King. For flatterie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to humoure Princes, and execute, not only what they commaund, but, what they incline or bend vnto, is a paſſion that's ouer-powerfull in Courtes, and blindeth many men, to worke their owne euerlaſting perdition. They embarked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they landed in England at a caſtell called <hi>Flatwide,</hi> aſſociated themſelues with others of great ranke, but little grace; and with manie armed men came marching to Canterbury, and went to the Archbishop, and with diſcurteous and vnſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely ſpeeches reuiled him for manie treaſons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Kings Maieſtie. The good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late anſwered to all their obiections, and with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and modeſtie, and yet with valour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, defended him ſelfe againſt all accuſations
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:181136:349"/>wherewith they did charge him; alleadging that for ſome of thoſe, which they eſteemed enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crimes, he had expreſſe leaue and licence from the King. At this they began to crye aloud and ſay, this was to touche the honour of the Kinge, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peache his Maieſtie of Treaſon; and fearing the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

At the noyſe of armes and armed men all the churche was in a tumult: ſome flying away; ſome hiding themſelues; ſome shutting faſt the doores of the Church. Only the Archbishop did ſo behaue himſelfe, as one deuoyde of all dread and feare: and comming to the doores did ſet them wide open: ſaying that Churches ought not to be defended as caſtles beſieged with enemies: and that he should ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, farre better with ſuffering, then with figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. In came they rushing to the Church, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out aloude: Where is that <hi>Beket</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop? Where is that Traytour to the King &amp; all his kingdome? He without any trouble or alteration anſwered: Heere I am, no Traitoure to the King; but a Prieſt and ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST; readie to leeſe my life for my Lord, and shed my bloud in defence of his Church.

               <p>The Monkes and cleargie men fearing to leeſe that precious treaſure of their Prelats bodie, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling together did ſtrippe him of his cloathes, &amp; found all his bodie, from the neck to the knees, couered with a rough haire shirt, and his breeches alſo made of hairecloth. With this token of his ſantity, &amp; the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of his vertues, they did shed many teares, ſaying one vnto another; how farre was he from affecting the Crowne, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after earthly honour, that did ſo deſpiſe and chaſtize his owne fleſh, as if it had bin his mortall enemies! They apparailed him in his Pontificall roabes, and buried him before the aultar of <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and of <hi>S.

All his conuerſation was a ſchoole of vertue, the rule of good manners, a patterne of ſaluation. He was vpright in iudging, induſtrious in executing, diſcreet in commaunding, modeſt in ſpeaking; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in his counſaile, moſt ſparing in his dyet, moſt liberall in giuing, peaceable in wrath, in flesh an Angell: meeke in iniuries, fearefull in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, well-aſſured in aduerſity, allmoſt lauish in almes giuing, and euen altogether mercie; the glorie of religious men, and the loue and greateſt delight of the people: with many other prayſes to the ſame purpoſe.</q> Neither is it only hee, but all the moſt famous men of thoſe dayes, who extoll <hi>S.

And ſurely God did manifeſtly declare, how acceptable this penance of the King was in his ſight.

And manie other proſperous ſucceſſes enſued this act of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the holy Saint euidently ayding him from Heauen, that humbled himſelfe ſo much vpon earth: and helping him, that ſubdued and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus himſelfe, to conquer, ſubdue, and gloriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly triumph ouer all his enemies.</p>

               </p>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Siluester</hi> was borne in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was the ſonne of <hi>Ruffinus.</hi> Spa: <hi>Cyrinus</hi> the prieſt was his

Before he was choſen to be Pope, he was taken by a gouernour in the city for receiuing &amp; harboring ſome Chriſtians, that came from places farre diſtant, as one of their relligyon. moreouer the gouernor willed <hi>Silueſter</hi> to delyuer into his hands the goods of certaine Chriſtians, that had bene martired, and had bene (as it was ſaid) left in his cuſtody: As they were leading S. <hi>Silueſter</hi> toward the priſon, his friends lamented, and made moane, and he told them, that his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment should not be long, and ſo it proued: for on the next night the iudge who had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, died, and on the next day he was ſet at liberty. <hi>Melchiades</hi> the Pope dying afterwards: S. <hi>Silueſter</hi> was ſet in the chayre of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To remedy and cure himſelfe he had bene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilled by the prieſts of the Gentils, to be washed in a baine of. 3000. Infants bloud. The good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour refuſed to commit that deteſtable cruelty,
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:181136:353"/>but choſe rather to dye of that infirmity, then to be cured by ſo inhumaine remedy.

               <p>That ſame night there appeared vnto him <hi>SS.

But when he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Emperour told him his dreame, whereat <hi>S.

               <p>And becauſe, whileſt the Counſell endured, this great and potent Emperour did a notable thing worthy of eternall memory, it shall not be amiſſe to write it in particular, that other ſeculer Princes may learne to make account of Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not to intromit to iudge their lifes, nor to breake their priuiledges and immunities.</p>
               <p>Great was the reſort of people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſundry nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto the Counſell, aſwell for to diſpute of the propoſitions of the <hi>Arryan</hi> heretiques, as alſo to craue Iuſtice, and to be remedyed of many aggrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances. Euery day were brought vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſupplications, ſceduls, or billes of complaints, againſt ſome of the Prelats. Aſwell of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as of ſome abſent: yea the Prelats made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, one of another. The Catholike Emperour tooke all theſe ſupplications, and kept them, and neuer read any of them. After vpon a day, in a full aſſembly of the fathers, he shewed them all their ſceduls and ſupplications, and ſaid vnto them: Our Lord God hath made you prieſts, and hath giuen you autority and power to iudge all men, and me alſo among others; So then, I muſt be iudged by you, and you can not be iudged by me, therefore
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:181136:355"/>awayt &amp; ſtay you for the iudgement of God. Your variances and controuerſies, let them be of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer matter they be, shalbe reſerued vnto the iudgement of God: I deſire you earneſtly yo leaue thoſe priuate quarels, and let vs all attend vnto the deciding of matters of faith, for the which, we are heere aſſembled. When he had ſaid thus: he threw all the writings into fier, to abolish and extinguish them for euer: A worthy deed of a renoumed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicephorus Calliſtus,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> a prieſt of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> ſay: that in this Counſell of <hi>Nice,</hi> there died two Bishops, the one called <hi>Griſantus,</hi> and the other Muſonius, before they could ſubſcribe vnto the decrees of the Counſel, and that the other Bishops went one night, vnto the place, where, the two Bishops were buried, and one, in the name of all the Counſell ſpooke vnto them, requeſting them, that hauing before their death approoued in the Counſell, that CHRIST is God, which <hi>Arrius</hi> denyed, that they would alſo ſubſcribe thereto, as the other Bishops had done: hauing ſaid thus, they laid the paper vpon their graues; and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their names were found to be ſubſcribed in that paper: and many of them, that were preſent, and knew their hand-writing, ſaid, that it was the hand of the deceaſed Bishops.</p>
               <p>The Counſell being finished and ended, all, that had bene determined therein, was ſent vnto Pope <hi>Silueſter,</hi> to be approued, and they alſo certified him, how the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> had banished the wicked man <hi>Arrius,</hi> and ſixe of his adherents.</p>
               <p>The Pope for the greater confirmation of the
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:181136:355"/>truth, (and for that he could not be in <hi>Nice,</hi> being farre diſtant from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the voyage long) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled another Counſell at <hi>Rome,</hi> of. 227. (Spa: 284.) Bishops, who being all of one opinion, and with one voyce, confirmed that, which had bene determined at <hi>Nice,</hi> by the. 318 Bishops: and againe condemned <hi>Arrius, Photinus,</hi> and <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arch heretiks.</p>
               <p>The Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> was holden and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the yeare of our ſaluation. 325. and therein was declared and decreed, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the head of all other Churchs: And that vnto him, the next is the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which had bene gouerned by S. <hi>Marke</hi> the Euangeliſt. The third in dignity, is the Church of <hi>Antioch;</hi> where S. <hi>Peter</hi> made his firſt reſidence, and the fourth is the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where <hi>S. Iames</hi> was the firſt Bishoppe.</p>
               <p>We read of many holeſome ſtatutes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces made by <hi>S. Silueſter:</hi> viz: That the prieſt hauing finished the Baptiſme, hee should anoynt his forehead with <hi>Chriſme,</hi> though this was vſed before, in ſome particuler Churches, as, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in <hi>Aphrica;</hi> for S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> before this, writing to <hi>Ianuarius,</hi> ſaith: It is fit and conuenient, that thou anoynt with oyle, the forehead of him, thou doeſt Baptize: So that Pope <hi>Silueſter</hi> commaunded it should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued through all the Church vniuerſally, which before was done, but in ſome particuler places.</p>
               <p>He commanded alſo, that the Corporals should be of white linnen cloth, not of ſilke, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtuffe, nor of any other collour.</p>
               <pb n="654" facs="tcp:181136:356"/>
               <p>That Bishops only should conſecrate the <hi>Criſme,</hi> and the ſame he might vſe in the ſacrament of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
               <p>He commaunded that the Deacons should vſe the <hi>Dalmatica</hi> or <hi>Tunicle</hi> and the maniples on the left arme. He forbad prieſts to goe to ſuite in law before ſeculer iudges, for any occaſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>In the time of this Pope was celebrated a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in a city neere vnto <hi>Granada,</hi> called <hi>Illiberis,</hi> and therefore the Counſell was called <hi>Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beritanum.</hi> Though that others ſay that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell was celebrated in another <hi>Illiberis,</hi> to wit: in <hi>Colybree.</hi> Another prouinciall Counſell was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in his time at <hi>Arlez</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and ſome others, in other parts: Whereby it is apparant that the faith, and the Goſpell was enlarged and ſpred very farre in many countries, and had taken deepe root in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame time, the people of <hi>Scotia,</hi> the moſt northerly parte of the Iſland <hi>Britannia,</hi> receiued the faith of CHRIST IESVS.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that Pope <hi>Silueſter</hi> chaunged the name of the dayes of the weeke, from the munday vntill the Saturday: for that the Pagans called them by the names of the Planets: viz. Munday of the <hi>Moone,</hi> Tueſday of <hi>Mars,</hi> Wedneſday of <hi>Mercury,</hi> Thurſday of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> Friday of <hi>Venus,</hi> and Satterday of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and appointed they should be called Ferias: the firſt, the ſecond, the third, fourth, fifth, ſixth, and Saterday: but this ordinaunce is not vſed at this preſent, but in the diuine offices: that which is commonly called Sunday, Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> 1. called it
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:181136:356"/>the <hi>Lords day</hi> though ſome called it ſo euen from the time of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Silueſter</hi> had very great care of the poore and needy, and had many memorialls, whereby he had alwayes the better meanes to know their needs, &amp; to prouide for their neceſſities. He had eſpeciall care, that the Recluſed Nonnes should haue all things neceſſary prouided for them, to the end, they should not go wandering out of their mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteryes, vnder pretext to ſeek their meat and drink, or any other neceſſary thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Silueſter</hi> liued in the papacy 23. years, 10. months, and 11. dayes, and then died, and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the Churchyard of <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> in the way cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Salaria;</hi> He gaue holy orders ſixe times in the month of <hi>December,</hi> and made 65. Prieſts and 26. Deacons.</p>
               <p>The Catholike Church celebrateth his feaſt, on the day, that he died, to wit: on the laſt day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> in the year of <hi>our Lord.</hi> 333. in the raigne of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great.</p>
